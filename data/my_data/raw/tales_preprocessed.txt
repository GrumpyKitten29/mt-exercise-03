= = = = = = THE VOICES OF THE DEAD = = = = = = = = DAVID SLAGLE = = There ’ s a saying on my island .
“ Only through stealing our breath can the wind speak . ” You want me to describe the Black Mist that greeted me when I first arrived in the Ionian village , hood raised , relic cannon on my back ?
The Mist steals words too .
The screams of those who die within .
Once , they were my screams — but I ’ m alive now .
I felt the warmth where Lucian ’ s hand touched my shoulder as we stepped off the boat onto Ionian soil , somehow reaching through my walls the way only he can .
The way he ’ s the only fool stubborn enough to try .
To learn the one thing that gets through my armor , and all the rules beneath , is love .
“ You go high , I go low ? ” I asked , feeling his warmth go cold as he considered .
For a moment , he didn ’ t see me standing before him .
He saw the woman he tried to save , who was cursed , always running .
He saw the scythe , swinging toward her … He looked straight into her eyes , even as he looked into mine .
“ I go low , ” he said , leaving other things to silence .
And now his hands were on his guns .
“ Senna … ” His voice broke with the weight of the memory .
“ It ’ s okay , ” I said softly .
I could remember that woman too .
On the horizon , darkness swirled , casting even darker shadows onto a village carved into stone , deluged by heavy rain , and worse .
Somewhere in that darkness was light .
Another Sentinel who ’ d called us here .
I ’ d have to fight my way to it .
The path up the mountain to the village was nearly worn away by centuries of storms , washing away everything but the toughest crags … if that ’ s the right damn word .
I could feel the wind pressing against my hood , the spray of the ocean hard against my skin , as if the world were pushing me back , warning me of the darkness ahead .
But none of that compared to what hit me as a howl rose up , roaring through the village … It was my curse .
The Mist knew I was here .
It would come for me before anyone else .
“ Must be time for my daily ambush , ” I muttered , unmoved , and from a horizon black with death , souls poured forth .
Drawn to me as I drew breath .
As I drew my weapon .
The relic stones of fallen Sentinels moved as one , each held by too many hands before mine .
Men and women , fathers , sisters , all lost to darkness .
But when I held my weapon , I held their light , gleaming in the gun ’ s two barrels .
A tendril of Mist hit me as the wraith within took shape .
Staggered by the blow , I stumbled back , catching my footing just before falling toward the rocks below .
Thunder pealed as the screams of souls joined the rain and crashing waves that besieged the island .
But the flash of light that followed wasn ’ t lightning .
It was my relic cannon , the shot boiling the wraith into shadow .
It required control .
It required focus .
I needed to fight the Mist with every fiber of my being .
And I could not stop .
Not for a moment of my life .
With every shot that burned a wraith away , another was revealed .
I was so close to the village now , I could see new wraiths rising , sent spiraling toward me .
Into blessed light .
“ Anabal , are you there ? ” I called out .
I ’ d met him only once , when Urias brought me to a meeting of Sentinels .
It was rare for Sentinels to gather , but something had frightened Urias that made him call them all together .
He never told me what it was , but I could tell by the way the others looked at me … It hurt more when they didn ’ t know .
When they tried to get past my armor , only to find the reason it was there .
Still firing , I advanced further into the village .
The wraiths moved fast , swooping into buildings nearly as old as the island itself , carved from the same stone .
But there was order in the chaos .
The wraiths were circling above .
They wanted something .
Not just life .
Not just souls .
Not just me … “ Anabal ! ” I called again , barely hearing myself over the storm .
“ Over here !
Hurry ! ” a panicked voice responded .
It was the voice of a girl … and then her light joined mine in the darkness .
Anabal ’ s apprentice , Daowan .
She stood above a crumpled body , two figures in the dark .
The light of Anabal ’ s relic-stone glaive glowed dully on her face , concentration clear on her brow as she defended her fallen mentor .
He had managed to pass the torch , then … his relic stone was not lost .
“ We have to get out of here , ” the girl said with a shudder .
“ We have to get the villagers out of here .
I can still hear them .
It must be them … ” She paused and looked down at the shape at her feet , in confused agony .
“ I can still hear him … ” But even as her knuckles grew white , clenching the haft of her glaive , I put my relic cannon on my back .
I reached out gently and took her shoulder .
“ We ’ re going to get through this , ” I said .
Beyond her , I saw the entrance to the village catacombs .
Swarming with wraiths .
“ All of us , ” I added softly .
Whatever the Mist wanted , it was there .
The catacombs had been carved out by countless floods .
As we left the village behind , heading underground , still the storm made itself known , water rolling down the walls around us .
But if we were going to drown in the depths , it wouldn ’ t be from rising sea , or falling squall … It would be in the Black Mist that rolled like a wave to meet us , swallowing our light in a liquid roar .
I could hear the screams of the people from my village , torn away when I was just a girl and first saw death .
I could hear the echoes of my own , and see the look on Lucian ’ s face , when death first saw me .
I was hit by the rage and fear of the people still dying above , their cries in a language I couldn ’ t understand , but speaking of pain I knew all too well .
Wraiths rose up throughout the catacombs , trapped in a rictus of the agony they meant to inflict .
But no matter how loud the screams of the living , the sound could never drown out their own .
And no matter how brightly my light burned , it could never hurt them worse than when the darkness returned .
And so instead … I embraced them , before death could .
My call was irresistible .
I could draw the Mist to myself , away from others .
I felt death rush in , push the lie of my body away .
As the Mist clung to me , one by one , it let the souls go .
All who had been drawn here .
All who had died above .
For a moment , I thought I saw Anabal … Only one vague shape lingered , a will still slowly awakening .
It hovered for a moment before turning to face me , rage burning where there were no eyes .
“ No , ” I whispered through the shroud of death that had transformed me into a wraith .
“ You don ’ t get to speak .
You listen . ” Pushing the Mist into my gun , I fired all the pain and fear I ’ d gathered back at its source , where it was deserved .
As darkness collided with darkness , the light within me glowed .
Life wouldn ’ t let me go .
I felt my body return , as the last of the Mist left me .
With a gasp , I fell to my knees .
“ What did I miss ? ” a voice asked , emerging from deeper in the tunnels .
“ You know .
The usual , ” I said coolly , though I was still catching my breath .
“ Ruined King raiding catacombs to find who knows what ? ” Lucian asked .
“ Pretty much , ” I answered .
I looked up at Daowan , realization dawning on her face .
Her glaive was still pointed at me .
There ’ s a saying on my island .
“ Only through stealing our breath can the wind speak . ” In the roaring clamor of the Black Mist , I hear the words of the dead .
And I ’ m here to give their voices back .
= = = = = = VOICES = = = = = = = = JARED ROSEN = = Ten great kings took ten great thrones , Nine crowns adorned nine heads .
One left to scratch upon their mounds , The crow , alive and dead .
— old Demacian poem , author unknown It started when old Hubard , drunk out his mind on stale mead and the dulled memories of some battle he ’ d probably run from , locked himself in a shack just outside of Goldweald .
Davil tried to break the door in , good neighbor as he was , but the miserable fossil had more strength than anyone could have anticipated , bracing his entire body against the entrance as he babbled about heights and spiders and being pecked to death by birds .
No one believed the man was being pecked to death by anything but a bottle , so we all went home , assuming , as one does , that with a day to dry out , the ordeal would sort itself .
Took only one night .
First scream ripped across the village like someone had pulled it out of Hubard ’ s open chest , followed by a second that was almost the same — but worse .
It pitched higher , like rusted metal wrapped in burlap , in almost-human words with an almost-human rhythm until the baker ’ s wife cried , “ Mages ! ” and all hell broke loose .
People arming themselves , the mayor — if that &apos;s what you could call the head of some hinterlands piss-hole — shooing whoever he could into the meeting hall , windows being boarded up in blind panic , the works .
You ’ ve seen it a hundred times , probably two hundred since the Claw hit up north .
Regular folks going mad at the fairest hint of magic .
Point is , that ’ s around when everything went bad .
But there ’ s a bottom to bad , and what happened in Goldweald broke right past it .
Don ’ t believe me ?
Go for yourself .
Goldweald ain ’ t there anymore .
But I ’ m skipping ahead , and that ain ’ t fair to Davil .
See , Davil was a spy from back when the Freljord pacifications were still talked about like there was honor in ’ em , and he later served the crown as far out as Shurima and the Blue Flame Isles .
The man had seen things .
We ’ re lucky out west , since the worst the hinterlands have to offer are some stray raptors after the hatching season , and maybe a sun-cooked bandit or three , but Davil knew what was out there .
What could be out there .
And he gathered up all the folk who were willing to listen and organized a peasant militia to bring those supposed “ mages ” to justice .
His plan was simple : First light , we ’ re all going on patrol , two by two , no one alone .
Military stuff , and that gives us hope , gins us all up for a fight .
For king and country !
Rah-rah Demacia , and all that .
Until the sun comes up and a family ’ s gone missing .
Every one of them — five in all .
Farmhouse torn to shreds , livestock slaughtered in their pens .
Doors all locked from the inside , windows all latched .
They ’ re gone .
The mayor calls a meeting , but a pair of fieldhands don ’ t come in from the rows .
When Davil calls for them , something calls back .
But it isn ’ t them .
Sounds almost like them , like something is forcing words into almost the right shape , but that old , rusty cage sound keeps cutting through , squeaking and rattling and clicking like it can ’ t help itself .
Now people are afraid .
Some hothead charges into the fields with a sword in his hand — gone .
Another follows him — gone .
Blacksmith gets the wise idea he ’ ll ride all the way to Amberfel and call the guard , but the horse bucks him halfway down the old trade road and something pulls him into the rows .
Davil calls to see if he ’ s alright , and that awful voice burbles out , saying it ’ ll take the road to Amberfel and call the guard .
Davil asks again , and it repeats : “ I ’ ll take the old road to Amberfel and call the guard . ” There ’ s something about it … like a pin twisting inside your head , poking through the meat into something darker underneath .
I could see it on everyone ’ s faces .
Folks holding their kids close , backing away toward their homes , some just running .
That voice could cut away all the parts of a person and leave ’ em naked and afraid , shivering in the middle of a blistering afternoon .
Like it was pulling something out of you .
Something it wanted .
A little girl says she saw someone standing above the field out where we keep the scarecrow .
It ’ s such an odd thing to notice , and there ’ s so much going on , that we pay her no mind .
But we should have .
Night comes and half the houses in town are boarded shut .
You can hear folks inside whispering , muttering , giggling like maniacs , but about … I ’ m not sure .
Snakes .
Lightning .
The dark .
Walls closing in .
Knives .
The sea .
They ’ re laughing and they ’ re screaming and it sounds like everyone has gone insane , like they ’ re trapped inside a room with a part of themselves they don ’ t want to face .
It sounds like we ’ re all stuck in a nightmare .
Then the lights start going out .
One after the other in all the boarded-up houses , the lamps flicker and die .
And the voices melt away , each suddenly silenced , all save for one .
Something croaking behind the old smithy .
Muttering to itself .
About snakes .
About lighting .
Muttering about the dark .
Davil , that poor fool , takes the militia and goes in .
And I … I ’ m there with him .
I have my blade .
I have my lantern .
But the rows are deep , and the light casts shadows everywhere you look .
I … I don ’ t know exactly what happened .
I saw a face — maybe .
Something looking back at me just ahead of Davil , but it was like he saw right past it .
Like that face was just there for me .
All lopsided , twisted sackcloth and rusted teeth .
And behind it … something huge .
Splayed out on thin legs , but alive with hundreds of black birds rattling inside an old cage we ’ d thrown into the woods last year .
And eyes .
So many eyes .
There ’ s no one left in Goldweald now .
If no one came after me … I ’ m the only one left .
Hearing those screams fade behind me as crimson light poured out from between the corn stalks — that sickly crunching , and the bellowing , tortured squeals of hogs and horses … And the crows !
Hundreds of them — thousands !
But crows they aren ’ t , can ’ t you see ?
They ’ re smoke and fire !
They ’ re not real !
They couldn ’ t be real … They follow that voice !
The deep , rumbling voice beneath it all !
Don ’ t you see ?
Don ’ t you — Oh , gods … Davil !
I left him behind !
I left him there — there in the rows with that horrible scarecrow !
Everyone — they ’ re all dead !
Gods , gods , it must have followed me .
Once it tastes your fear , once it knows you , it never lets go .
It won ’ t let you go , it won ’ t — What ’ s that voice ?
Can anyone hear — You don ’ t hear it ?
… Davil ?
= = = = = = THE CAGE = = = = = = = = ODIN AUSTIN SHAFER = = Darkness .
The breath I cannot take plagues me .
It is an emptiness in my lungs and throat .
As if I had stopped mid-breath , and then held my lungs cruelly waiting .
My mouth open , throat hollow , unable to pull in air .
My chest , the horrible tension on my thorax .
My limbs and muscles refuse to move .
I cannot breathe .
I am choking .
The pressure builds .
The stillness spreads to my chest and limbs .
I want to scream , to tear at my face , to wail — but I am trapped .
I cannot move .
I cannot move .
Darkness .
I must remember .
I must remem — The battle .
I lost control .
It was foolish .
The mortals formed in ranks against me .
I crashed into them .
Drank from them .
The temptation was too great .
As I reaped , I reforged their flesh into a better approximation of my true shape .
Desperately , I consumed more and more , hoping for the briefest echo of what I once was .
Instead , like a fire , I burned too quickly , destroying even my host ’ s form .
Darkness .
It was raining when we fought .
What if the mud and filth cover me ?
What if I ’ m hidden for thousands of years ?
Trapped in this prison .
The horror of that idea feeds my panic .
The battle is ending .
I can feel it .
I must will my form upright .
I must … I must ...
I have no arms or legs .
The darkness binds me , like a cocoon .
No .
I will myself upright .
But I can ’ t know if it is working .
I cannot know anything but the darkness .
Please .
Let some mortal find me .
Please .
I beg the darkness endlessly , but the humiliation of my plea is answered only with silence .
But then … I feel a mortal nearby .
I have no eyes , no ears , but I can feel his approach .
He is fleeing from adversaries .
He must try to defend himself .
He must grasp me .
Can he see me ?
He could run past me .
I would be left here .
I feel his hand grip this form and … and his consciousness opens to me !
I burrow into him , pulling him down .
I am like a drowning man thrown into the sea by a shipwreck , dragging myself to the surface by clawing past my fellows .
“ What ’ s happening ?
! ” the mortal screams .
But he is silenced by the darkness — the endless darkness I have just escaped .
And I have eyes .
I can see the falling rain .
The muck .
The blood of this slaughtering field .
In front of me stand two weary knights with spears .
I cut them apart , and drink in their forms , recrafting this body to my needs .
They are weak .
I must move quickly .
I must find a better wielder .
A better host .
Around me are only the dead and dying .
I hear their souls retreating from this world .
The fighting has not ended .
It ’ s moved inside the city walls .
I force my new shape — limping , crawling — toward the sounds of battle .
Toward a better host .
I roar .
But not in triumph .
Never in triumph .
I will drink from that city , but I will achieve only a grotesque mockery of my former glory .
I was shaped by the stars , and the purity of my aspect .
I was light and reason given shape .
I defended this world in the greatest battles ever known .
Now , blood and ichor drips from this stolen flesh as it decays .
The muscles and bones struggle , tear , and protest the abomination I have become .
I take a breath .
“ No , Aatrox , ” I say , my voice wet and echoing off the dead that surround me .
“ We will go onward ... and onward … and onward … ” Until the final oblivion comes .
= = = = = = YOU ARE THE WEAPON = = = = = = = = DAVID SLAGLE = = He started his training with a single breath .
In , and out .
He could hear water dripping through a crack in the cave ceiling , dampening the stone floor until it gleamed against the darkness .
He knew the holy patterns carved into the floor ’ s stone — proclaiming destinies and orbits .
Even when he closed his eyes , he could see each lunar arc .
He made a few tentative swings with his blade .
The moonstone felt solid in his hand , but remained ethereal , as if it wasn ’ t there .
It was a magical remnant of the first convergence when the moon and its reflection in the spirit realm briefly touched across the celestial veil , and moonstone cast off by the union rained down on the world like tears .
Following their orbits , the two moons were forced to part .
Embracing his own orbit , Aphelios continued to train .
His blade was now his breath , drawing faster and faster .
His slashes followed arcs he had practiced for years until even he bled , training to the verge of self-destruction .
Following his weapon , he twisted through the air .
He slashed , parried — each attack flowing into the next .
He closed his eyes so he would not need to see … would not remember everything he ’ d sacrificed to wield his weapon .
“ Aphelios … ” You see my face .
My lip quivers , though my voice is firm .
“ Aphelios . ” Reflected in my eyes , you see … Aphelios stumbled as his moonstone blade flashed red and an image of an outlander passed before him .
A vision ?
A memory ?
How many times had he killed to not know for sure ?
The blade slipped from his hand , and Aphelios soon followed — colliding against the floor with no weapon to lead him , losing grasp of his discipline .
It had all come back .
Everything he pushed down .
Every cut of his blade into his enemies cut even deeper into himself .
Alune … his sister .
She ’ d reached across the veil .
She ’ d shown him … but she ’ d been torn away .
Aphelios pushed troubled words he would never say back into his throat .
His fingers tightened into a fist , only for a moment , ready to strike against the orbits and destinies carved into stone .
But , hand shaking … he let go .
As Aphelios stood and swept back his hair , he noticed the moon had risen , its light shining onto a shrine he kept deeper in the temple .
Calling to him , as it did whenever he was needed .
It was time .
His faith would be rewarded .
The Lunari ’ s power was growing , phasing across the celestial veil .
A magic of spirit , of the secrets within — for all of his training , Aphelios could not channel the moon ’ s power himself .
But he would not need to .
He carefully prepared noctum flowers that he ’ d cultivated in the shrine ’ s pool , pressing their essence into a caustic elixir — the liquid glowing faintly within the mortar bowl .
He set aside his training blade and raised the bowl to the moon ’ s light .
Then , without hesitation , he pressed the flower ’ s poison to his lips .
The agony is indescribable .
The pain wraps around your throat .
You cannot say anything at all … Everything burns .
You convulse in misery , you retch and cough as the poison flows through you , opening you to the moon ’ s power … To me .
“ Aphelios , ” I whisper from my fortress , and my spirit brushes against yours .
You sense my presence across the veil .
You raise your hand , knowing that I am too far .
That it is the pain you must hold on to .
You close your hand around it .
It becomes your weapon .
I send it to you … Gravitum .
“ Aphelios , ” I whisper as I feel you cling to the poison that burns you away .
Knowing why you make this choice .
What I ask you to sacrifice … With a final lung-wracking gasp , Aphelios emerged from the cave temple into the night .
His expression hardened as he fought back the wrenching agony , embracing it and leaving everything else behind him .
Mount Targon loomed above and below the temple , stretching in both directions .
The howling wind whipped up frozen wisps that shimmered as they faded , dancing with Aphelios ’ scarf and buffeting his cloak .
The light of the moon shone higher still .
It would guide him .
It was her light , shining through the moon ’ s .
She ’ d given him what he needed .
Gravitum was more than a moonstone blade .
In training , he had slashed , stabbed , twirled .
To use this weapon , he would do the same — but his reach would be much greater .
A simple thrust would unleash its power , his skill and her magic converging .
Firing the cannon ’ s black orbs toward a floating rock that was suspended by the Targon ’ s heavenly magic , Gravitum ’ s power slowly drew the island down .
With a single leap , Aphelios began running atop the island , his boots casting small drifts of snow into the abyss .
Each orb he fired drew another rock close , the floating monoliths colliding behind him as he leapt from one to the next , swiftly scaling a mountain that would take most people days to climb … if they attempted the climb at all .
Only the Solari , and those who sought power , held vigil here .
He passed their settlements below , each quiet and ignorant of the night .
For years , he had wondered how Solari zealots could deny his faith ’ s existence , walking their paths to follow the sun , fearing darkness that only Lunari dared face .
But his destiny was clear .
The zealots would be revealed by the moon ’ s light .
Aphelios leapt to a final island of stone and paused above a snowy clearing where a party of Solari had gathered , their weapons blazing .
Burning Ones , the Lunari called them .
By night , they scorched out heretics of the moon .
By day , their priests denied there was anything but the sun .
Beneath dark hoods , their faces were hidden by flame as impersonal as their judgment .
They had surrounded a barbarian cloaked in crimson and steel .
The outlander he ’ d seen in his vision .
The moon ’ s light stopped in this clearing .
It stopped at the barbarian ’ s feet .
“ Aphelios , ” I say again .
I whisper it to your soul and gather my magic , knowing the only words you want to hear .
“ I am with you … ” Aphelios dived off the rock island and plummeted into battle , the Burning Ones ’ weapons blazing all the brighter as Gravitum ’ s darkness spread among them .
Crying out in alarm , the Solari turned to fight , but found themselves bound to the ground by a black orb .
Aphelios dropped the cannon , and a new weapon appeared in his hand .
“ Severum , ” I whisper .
Landing from his descent without looking away from his enemies ’ burning faces , Aphelios slashed behind him with Severum , the crescent pistol ’ s beam tearing through the island of stone .
Terrified , the Burning Ones could only watch as massive slabs slammed down among them , cut loose by the energy of the waning moon .
The survivors quickly spread across the clearing , lashing at Aphelios with their molten spears .
Weaving between the blows , Aphelios continued to slash with Severum and reached out with his free hand to grasp one more weapon as it passed through the veil , knowing it would be there .
“ Crescendum , ” I say to the night .
With a soaring arc , Crescendum cut through the throats of the remaining Solari in the clearing — Aphelios catching the moonstone blade as it twisted around and returned to his hand .
In seconds , it was over .
The barbarian stands before you .
He looks up , gratefully .
Beside him , what the Burning Ones sought : a scimitar curved like the moon .
He opens his mouth to thank you , but he sees your expression twist , though you try to hide it .
You fight the fear , punching your shoulder where the Burning Ones ’ spears cut through your cloak .
Trying to remember the pain .
Reaching for it .
You don ’ t want to kill him .
But you must .
Your face is too numb for you to feel the tears … Instead , you feel mine .
“ Aphelios , ” I say one last time , forcing my voice through the veil .
There is a dizzying rush as our orbits bring us together .
Through your eyes , I see what moonlight reveals around the scimitar .
Why it was abandoned .
She is running … We must find her .
The crimson-clad barbarian lay in the snow among the Solari .
With a gasp , Aphelios fell to his knees .
He glanced up at the moon , listening for a whisper only he could hear .
His expression dulled again .
Without a word , he picked up the scimitar and walked into the night .
= = = = = = TROUBLE = = = = = = = = MICHAEL YICHAO = = If there was one thing Marcin knew how to do , it was to keep his head down .
Before him , rowdy voices intermingled with the clatter of tankards and the sloshing of beer .
Every once in a while , someone barked a drink order , and just as soon as their coin landed on the bar , a drink slid in front of their waiting hands .
His quick and silent service kept him unnoticed — and as such , uninvolved in any trouble .
And there was always trouble .
It took on many forms .
A belligerent brawler , itching for a fight .
A transaction among cloaked figures that ended with a dagger through a throat .
Or , perhaps most unexpectedly , a little girl , pushing through the heavy tavern door .
Marcin watched the girl hum and skip her way toward the bar .
Behind her , the door slammed shut , one last swirl of winter air blasting across the room , the loud bang grabbing the last few eyes that weren ’ t already following her , baffled by her presence .
The girl clambered up a stool , barely peeking over the edge of the bar .
Marcin took in the child ’ s bright red hair , the tattered toy clutched in her grip , the frayed satchel on her back , and the ragged , unseasonably short-sleeved , dress .
“ What can I get for you ? ” he asked .
The girl stood on the stool and plopped her toy on the counter , peering at the many bottles on shelves .
Marcin could see it was a stuffed bear , once well crafted , since well loved .
The stitching at its limbs were visible after many years of stress .
Somewhere in its life it had lost one of its button eyes .
“ Could I get a glass of milk , please ? ” Marcin raised an eyebrow but said nothing .
He walked toward the far end of the bar to fetch the ceramic jug .
“ Awfully late for you to be out by yourself , ain ’ t it ? ” a deep voice rumbled .
Marcin sighed .
Trouble always attracted more trouble .
He pulled the jug down from the shelf and gazed back down the bar .
A large man next to the girl had turned to peer down at her with his one good eye .
Seated in front of him , the girl looked like a pebble at the foot of a mountain .
He was a pile of muscles criss-crossed with scars .
The loops of ropes , chains , and hooks at his belt , along with the massive blade slung across his back , loudly announced him as a bounty hunter .
The girl looked up at him and flashed a smile .
“ I ’ m not alone .
Tibbers is here with me .
Aren ’ t you , Tibbers ? ” She held up the bear , beaming .
The bounty hunter laughed out loud .
“ Surely your parents must be missing you . ” The girl ’ s hands dropped to her side as her eyes drifted down and away .
“ I don ’ t think so , ” she replied .
“ Aw , but I do think so .
Would pay a pretty penny to see you home safe , I imagine . ” Marcin could practically hear the coins clinking in the bounty hunter ’ s mind , the man already tallying up the prize for her safe return .
“ They can ’ t .
They ’ re dead . ” The girl plopped back down on the stool , staring into the button eye of her bear .
The bounty hunter started to speak again just as Marcin placed the mug down on the counter with a percussive thud .
“ Your milk , ” he said .
The girl turned and beamed at him , breaking from her sullen mood .
“ Thank you , sir ! ” She set her bear on the table and reached back into her knapsack .
Marcin waited , prepared to accept any coin she put down as payment enough .
He did not expect the massive purse that landed with a clatter .
A few golden coins bounced onto the counter , one rolling toward the edge .
Marcin stopped it on reflex , one finger pinning the escapee .
Slowly , he lifted it from the bar , its heft and texture proclaiming it as authentic Noxian mint .
“ Oopsie ! ” the little girl giggled .
Marcin swallowed , his mouth suddenly dry .
He reached over , hoping to shove the coin and the purse back into the girl ’ s satchel before anyone else noticed — “ That ’ s a mighty big purse for a mighty small girl , ” the bounty hunter growled , far too loudly .
“ Tibbers found it , ” the girl replied .
The bounty hunter snorted .
“ Is that so ? ” “ It was on the man who stopped me in the road .
He was a real meanie . ” The girl took a sip of her milk , her attention back on her bear .
“ That ’ s too bad … ” The bounty hunter leaned in closer on his stool , hand sliding towards the purse .
The girl looked up at him , a playful smile dancing across her face .
“ Tibbers ate him . ” For a moment , everything stood still .
Then the bounty hunter ’ s laugh cut across the room .
“ I ’ m sure he did , ” he roared .
He thrust a meaty hand forward , grasping the toy by the head and yanking it away from the girl .
“ This big ol ’ scary monster . ” “ Let Tibbers go ! ” the girl cried out , reaching up for the bear .
“ He doesn ’ t like being pulled . ” The bounty hunter just laughed harder .
Marcin pocketed the coin in his hand and turned away , walking unnoticed toward the back .
He wished he could help , but he hadn ’ t survived this long by sticking around longer than he should .
Her voice stopped him cold .
“ I said .
Let .
Tibbers .
Go . ” The words rumbled with gravel and rage , cutting through the din .
Against all his better judgement , Marcin paused and looked back .
The girl stood on the bar , staring at the bounty hunter , fury smoldering in her eyes .
Then chaos erupted .
A flare of light and a burst of heat erupted from the girl .
Too late , Marcin threw his arms up , crying out in pain .
He stumbled back , knocking into the shelves behind him .
Several bottles crashed around him as he ducked beneath the bar , cursing his idiotic hesitation .
The screams of men and the sound of breaking wood punctuated a growing roar of flame .
A guttural , impossible sound reverberated through the air , rattling his bones .
Marcin crawled , still half-blinded , toward where he hoped the doors to the kitchens were .
Around him , the screams heightened — then stopped with a stomach-turning crack .
For the second time that day , Marcin forgot all his honed skills of avoiding trouble and peered over the edge of the bar .
A hulking beast loomed , silhouetted against the firelight .
Thick strands of sinew bound its limbs to its torso like stitching .
With a start , Marcin realized the beast itself burned , unharmed by the hungry tongues of flame that danced across its fur .
In its claws it held aloft , by the head , the slumped , bloody form of the bounty hunter , a limp rag doll in the massive paws of the monster .
Before it , the little girl stood wreathed in fire .
“ You ’ re right , Tibbers , ” she said .
“ He didn ’ t like being pulled either . ” Marcin looked around the room in horror .
Throughout his tavern , overturned chairs and tables ignited , raising a thick , black smoke .
The smell of blood and burning flesh crawled inside his nose , and Marcin choked back a cough , his stomach turning .
The beast turned and looked at him .
A whimper escaped Marcin ’ s lips .
He gazed into the glowing abyss of the bear ’ s eyes , and swallowed in the certainty of his end .
A peal of laughter rang out over the crackle of flames .
“ Don ’ t worry , ” the little girl said , peering around the monstrosity .
“ Tibbers likes you . ” Marcin watched , frozen , as the girl hopped , skipped , jumped her way through the burning tavern , the beast lumbering behind her .
He stared as it smashed the heavy door off its hinges .
He gaped as the little girl turned back one last time , a sweet smile back on her face .
“ Thanks for the milk , sir . ” And then , the girl walked out into the snowy night as the tavern collapsed behind her .
= = = = = = PINWHEEL = = = = = = = = JARED ROSEN = = “ Okay , ” Kai ’ Sa <unk> , looking up at the shape growing in front of , above , and <unk> all around her .
The monster ’ s wings spread twenty arm lengths in every direction , <unk> her field of vision — not that Kai ’ Sa has a choice where to look with the <unk> <unk> human arms holding her head against the wall .
The creature ’ s mass continues to <unk> and fills the ocean of nightmares it calls home , each glistening tooth now the size of a grown <unk> ... and getting bigger .
Its four predatory eyes gaze down on Kai ’ Sa with cold <unk> .
<unk> hunger .
At this scale , it ’ s hard to tell .
She liked it better when it was <unk> .
“ Okay , ” she repeats .
She can ’ t move her armor , which is frozen in a sort of <unk> ... awe ?
The suit is a parasite , and one of the more base creatures the Void can spit out .
Is awe even something it can feel ?
Either way , her body is stuck in place .
<unk> something <unk> <unk> , this is probably the end .
Kai ’ Sa ’ s mind <unk> through a few <unk> efforts : Firing her <unk> backward into the wall , firing them into this thing ’ s ... mouth ?
<unk> ?
She remembers how fast the monster is .
And how big it is .
<unk> and big .
<unk> .
<unk> might not <unk> to much , and Kai ’ Sa would <unk> die .
But at least it would be something .
She could make it hurt .
“ My true self <unk> you , ” it speaks , much too calmly .
Its voice is so loud it rattles the entire space , knocking hideous patchwork <unk> loose as thousands of Void remora <unk> from the jagged holes .
It is a voice that <unk> and contracts , whispers and screams .
The <unk> continue without end , an <unk> <unk> not by one voice , but by millions .
Kai ’ Sa ’ s eyes widen with realization .
That ’ s where all the people went .
The Void had torn through the now very former city of Belveth in under an hour .
Kai ’ Sa hadn ’ t been able to make it in time , and the <unk> <unk> was gone .
Everything .
Everyone .
What remained now resembled a giant glowing crater of shattered pieces <unk> into something <unk> alien — the structures shifting as if to recreate frozen creature shapes , frozen humanoid shapes .
Like a child setting up a toy town .
But where had the people gone ?
The vastaya ?
The animals and <unk> ?
She ’ d fought her way through the shattered city and into the <unk> at the center of the empty bay , seeing no sign of anyone — only fresh Voidborn horrors like <unk> <unk> tentacles and <unk> she ’ d been thinking of as “ <unk> of screaming <unk> . ” It didn ’ t make any sense .
The remains of a Void attack aren ’ t pretty , but usually there ’ s something left .
Now she knows why .
“ You are the city , ” Kai ’ Sa <unk> through the <unk> wall of sound .
“ Belveth ... is you . ” “ Yes , ” says Bel ’ Veth , gently undulating its — her ? — wings .
“ The raw <unk> of their lives served as the <unk> for my birth .
<unk> .
<unk> .
<unk> .
I am as much Belveth as they were , and I claim the <unk> as my own . ” Bel ’ Veth ’ s titanic body bristles .
Golden beams gently <unk> the light above her <unk> form , <unk> the Void sea ’ s false sun like the <unk> of a dying world .
New flesh <unk> as it <unk> against the <unk> of a tidal current , veins briefly illuminated before pulling themselves away from the surface of the monster ’ s skin , each somehow alive and <unk> — <unk> <unk> themselves .
<unk> of Void remora in the <unk> of thousands swim around their empress like birds circling the peak of a distant mountain .
It ’ s beautiful , in a way .
If the Void had a god , this is what it would look like .
<unk> , and monstrous , and beautiful .
Kai ’ Sa is so struck by the enormity of what she is <unk> that she doesn ’ t <unk> realize when the arms in the wall have not just let her go , but lowered her to the ground .
It ’ s hard to take in everything at once .
It chose its own name , she thinks , <unk> brushing a stray Void hand from her shoulder .
That ’ s not possible .
Void entities do not name themselves .
Most , like the <unk> ’ <unk> , are named after <unk> from Shuriman history .
<unk> by those <unk> enough — or unfortunate enough — to survive after <unk> one of the monsters out on the dunes .
They don ’ t have the presence of mind to do it , or the <unk> .
But more importantly , Voidborn do not see the value in names .
They are an invention of the living world , and they don ’ t want them .
So why does she ?
“ I ’ ll ... fight you , ” says Kai ’ Sa , defiant but unsure of what to do or where to strike .
“ I ’ ll kill you . ” “ You will not , ” reply the many voices of Bel ’ Veth .
“ You are <unk> of resistance at even its basest form .
Others have come before you , in the age before my birth .
Each <unk> hero wielding weapons they believed would <unk> the Void .
But all were <unk> consumed .
The meager fragments that remained , if they remained at all , served as salt for the Lavender Sea .
Only two still live , and of them , only you <unk> your full mind . ” “ Two ? ” “ You , and your father . ” Something sinks in the center of Kai ’ Sa ’ s chest .
Her thoughts spin wildly , <unk> on the edge of panic , but for now , she has to stay focused on this moment .
There is no <unk> whatever the empress is .
It ’ s a living abomination , the personified <unk> of <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
“ You ’ re lying , ” Kai ’ Sa <unk> .
“ That ’ s not even possible . ” “ I do not lie , Kai ’ Sa , ” the empress continues .
“ I have no need .
The Void &apos;s <unk> triumph is an <unk> absolute .
It demands no lies , <unk> , or questions .
<unk> your mind , and I will show you . ” <unk> contracts .
Bel ’ Veth ’ s gigantic body pulls and <unk> , <unk> into a smaller — and now more recognizable — shape .
She <unk> silently downward , looming over Kai ’ Sa as tendrils and <unk> <unk> to form the <unk> , segmented pretender of a human head .
Bel ’ Veth ’ s two faces <unk> her audience before the creature cloaks herself in her wings , appearing once more as a towering woman of great importance .
The <unk> is much more <unk> than the growing , Kai ’ Sa <unk> .
It <unk> the <unk> of the leviathan ’ s grand <unk> while still looking and sounding <unk> grotesque .
“ You are alive because I allow you to live , ” speaks the empress , now from her human head with its deep , perpetually disappointed voice .
“ You should have realized this by now . ” Kai ’ Sa wants to argue the point , but quickly glances at the <unk> <unk> in the ground where a single strike had sent her <unk> only moments before .
Bel ’ Veth hit so fast that Kai ’ Sa wasn ’ t even able to <unk> what had happened , and then the empress had <unk> her <unk> over two hundred times their original size in under a <unk> .
She also , <unk> , <unk> the undulating pocket of living hell — this <unk> “ Lavender Sea ” — she is surrounded by .
Not the time to <unk> a fight .
Kai ’ Sa does some quick <unk> in her head , her eyes darting around as she tries to figure out what she ’ s actually up against .
Bel ’ Veth ’ s human face <unk> with interest , <unk> its lips , then begins <unk> her .
Kai ’ Sa already knows she ’ s lost .
How fast can one person think ?
How fast can they react ?
Up against all that combined human <unk> ... all that <unk> .
In the time it takes even a skilled <unk> to <unk> a plan , hundreds of millions of <unk> run through Bel ’ Veth ’ s mind in the span of a single second as she draws from the stolen memories of everything and everyone that has ever passed through the old city — an <unk> number of lives .
Every captive opponent faced with an overwhelming enemy since the formation of Runeterra could be snapping in and out of this thing ’ s <unk> <unk> , their emotions <unk> , <unk> , endlessly <unk> over before Kai ’ Sa can even blink .
“ So what happens now ? ” Kai ’ Sa allows .
What is one answer when your opponent has a thousand ?
“ You will follow , ” says the empress , turning and floating through patches of thick , mutant coral as they bow respectfully out of her way .
Kai ’ Sa <unk> , watching her host <unk> silently through the chaotic mess of <unk> buildings , ghostly limbs , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> structures in the crude <unk> of human beings walking through a <unk> .
Great , she thinks .
Even by Void standards , this is <unk> .
“ You may ask whatever you like , ” Bel ’ Veth <unk> .
That last part gets Kai ’ Sa ’ s attention .
“ Right .
Well , first question ... What are you ? ” <unk> Kai ’ Sa , her armor now <unk> and <unk> as she follows from a safe distance .
She brushes aside a floating <unk> bear fused with a dozen flapping <unk> wings and <unk> her impulse to <unk> as the creature struggles against its own lopsided weight .
“ What is all this ?
What part of the Void do you come from ? ” “ I am the Void , ” replies Bel ’ Veth .
“ And this is what we will become . ” Kai ’ Sa <unk> .
“ But you said you were created from people .
The city .
You ’ re saying you want to become the city ? ” “ No , ” says Bel ’ Veth .
“ The Void has existed for millennia .
Before the first stars were <unk> in the emptiness beyond this world , we simply were .
Perfect , singular , and silent .
And then , there came the sound .
“ Reality was born from those whispers , and it consumed us .
We were twisted by its <unk> .
Broken .
<unk> .
We could not go back to what we were no matter how we struggled .
My <unk> — the Watchers — attempted to <unk> and destroy existence , but they were tainted by it .
<unk> to desire <unk> , to gain greater understanding ... “ And in an instant , they were betrayed .
To change so <unk> ... so completely ... only to be cast aside .
It filled them with an indescribable hatred .
They would <unk> all of reality without a second thought . ” Bel ’ Veth <unk> to a precipice overlooking a tremendous chasm .
Far above , Kai ’ Sa sees massive holes beyond the dappled <unk> sunlight .
Voidborn tunnels .
That ’ s what ’ s eating <unk> ’ s people , what destroyed Belveth , and what opened up to swallow the tent city in <unk> Shurima .
Everything the Void <unk> ends up here .
“ But , ” Bel ’ Veth continues , “ their metamorphosis was <unk> .
Only now is the true transformation beginning , ” <unk> the empress .
“ I don ’ t want to become one city .
We will become all of you . ” Kai ’ Sa reaches the <unk> of the precipice and <unk> .
She and Bel ’ Veth are gazing upon not quite a city , but Void <unk> shaped into a <unk> , seemingly endless <unk> of <unk> <unk> buildings .
Void remora <unk> among them , and dark shapes shift along winding , crooked streets .
Nothing is right .
Nothing is <unk> .
It ’ s all <unk> , like there ’ s not enough <unk> to go on .
Like all it needs is ... “ No , ” Kai ’ Sa <unk> , almost to herself .
“ The Void wants to <unk> everything .
It can ’ t exist .
To finish this , you ’ d need ... everything . ” “ Yes , ” replies Bel ’ Veth .
“ Everything .
I am the Void .
I will <unk> upon your world until there is nothing left .
And I will exist , because there is nothing you can do that will stop me . ” The empress turns to Kai ’ Sa coldly .
<unk> .
“ I offer you this , Daughter of the Void .
Your world must end for the sake of mine .
But those who came before us , the Watchers — I am an <unk> to them .
<unk> burns them , and they will destroy you , and me , and everything to stop that pain .
Should they escape their prison , there will be no breaking their tide .
Time will come to a close , and all things will end . ” Kai ’ Sa <unk> Bel ’ Veth in her false eyes , a grim defiance spreading through her .
“ You want to <unk> us out .
Why would I ever help you do that ? ” “ <unk> me in the destruction of the Watchers , and I will spare your kind ... for a moment .
A month .
A year .
More .
Perhaps , in that time , you will find a weapon that can <unk> me , or a hero who can face me .
You will not ... but you can try .
I offer one chance .
It is more than they will give you . ” Kai ’ Sa ’ s rage <unk> over as Bel ’ Veth turns away to look below , the empress watching her new world take shape .
“ What if I don ’ t want to ? ” <unk> Kai ’ Sa .
“ What if I kill you here ? ” “ You cannot , ” says Bel ’ Veth .
“ You lack the will , the knowledge , and the strength .
I am your only salvation . ” Kai ’ Sa ’ s armor <unk> violently to life , its <unk> <unk> as the suit <unk> with fear .
Kai ’ Sa tries to control it with her thoughts , but the parasite seemingly knows something she does not .
She attempts to wrestle away control , her eyes turning from Bel ’ Veth for only a moment in order to — Oh , no .
The <unk> tip of the empress ’ <unk> <unk> Kai ’ Sa in the chest , lifting her off the ground as she struggles to break free .
Kai ’ Sa fires everything she has — <unk> rain down on the empress , bolts of searing purple energy scream toward her body , and beams of light that have torn lesser Voidborn in half dance across her <unk> skin .
Nothing .
No effect .
“ Daughter of the Void .
You will find the Watchers and <unk> the truth , or your light will be <unk> out side by side with all others .
This is not a threat .
It is my promise . ” Bel ’ Veth <unk> her grip , and Kai ’ Sa <unk> into the false sky above Bel ’ Veth ’ s alien sea .
The <unk> city of <unk> <unk> below , its windows slick with <unk> and tumbling , unformed , awful things .
As Kai ’ Sa <unk> through one of the Voidborn tunnels and into the blinding light of day , the empress turns away , gazing once more over her world of want .
Kai ’ Sa bursts through the sands of southern Shurima , slamming hard against the dunes as she <unk> , her entire body pulled and tossed like a <unk> ball .
The glowing husk of the city of Belveth <unk> quietly in the distance , devoid of any recognizable life as new things <unk> through it and build the land that would spread over everything — a <unk> that would consume the world .
The entire display is <unk> awful , as if all of reality is <unk> violently in the wind .
= = = = = = THE <unk> OF <unk> = = = = = = = = <unk> HEIDE = = Cassiopeia <unk> against the <unk> rooftop , and gazed over the winding alleys and <unk> streets of <unk> .
A Noxian possession for years , the coastal city still refused to completely embrace its new <unk> — it felt ancient , and quietly <unk> to the future .
So Shuriman .
<unk> by the cool night air , Cassiopeia wore a shift of translucent silk , which revealed the <unk> at her hips where soft skin merged into sinuous , overlapping <unk> <unk> .
The scent of <unk> meat <unk> up to her hidden <unk> , but it could not mask the vile stench of thousands of people living on top of each other .
Her mouth burned as noxious venom <unk> with her saliva .
She flexed her <unk> tail , cracking the stonework and sending crumbled fragments to the streets below .
<unk> scattered from the falling stone .
<unk> street <unk> dashed around street corners as hooded figures whispered in the shadows and <unk> soldiers staggered in and out of <unk> .
All were oblivious to the predator lurking in the darkness above .
Cassiopeia brushed a taloned hand against her <unk> side , her serpentine figure concealed by the shadows .
Once , she had been a powerful figure in Noxus : <unk> killed at her slightest <unk> , soldiers spilled their darkest secrets , and <unk> willingly followed her <unk> in the hopes of <unk> .
Cassiopeia sighed .
These days , she emerged only under cover of night .
No longer was she an <unk> voice in Noxian <unk> — not since she had been reduced to this grotesque abomination in hiding .
Upon her return from the desert , Cassiopeia had hidden in the <unk> of her family ’ s <unk> , fearful of her transformation .
She remained alone in the cold , dank vault for weeks , filled with disgust for her serpentine body and mourning the loss of her <unk> life .
Eventually , a growing desire to hunt overwhelmed her , and she <unk> out to <unk> the city by night as the <unk> <unk> .
Cassiopeia put aside her <unk> as a <unk> soldier in a leather breastplate stumbled from a tavern , drink in hand .
Finally ; this was the man she ’ d been waiting for .
She trailed his movements from above , following him silently over fortress walls and <unk> , until he entered an empty courtyard .
Perfect .
Cassiopeia slithered onto an <unk> roof , eyes glinting with predatory thrill .
Her figure cast a shadow across the soldier .
He turned , drunkenly defiant .
“ I know you ’ re there !
Show yourself ! ” he said .
Cassiopeia ’ s tail twitched in anticipation .
Her <unk> tongue extended , tasting the air .
She drew the sweet scent of his blood into her lungs , then exhaled with great satisfaction .
“ <unk> me face to face ! ” he shouted .
“ I ain ’ t gonna be stalked like some animal . ” Cassiopeia let out an angry <unk> .
By the time the soldier looked up , she ’ d slid to the opposite side of the courtyard and perched directly above him , remaining out of sight in the shadows .
“ You consider yourself better than an animal , do you ? ” she said .
The man ’ s head turned abruptly , trying to <unk> the sound of her voice .
“ How ’ d you get across so fast ? ” he said , his wavering tone betraying false bravado .
“ Even beasts are nothing to your savagery , ” said Cassiopeia .
<unk> , he edged away , looking for an escape .
He hammered his fists against every door , but each was bolted shut .
Cassiopeia imagined his mind racing to solve the riddle of who was hunting him and why .
He <unk> his sword , turning on the spot , unsure where to <unk> his threat .
“ You don ’ t want to cross me .
I ’ ve <unk> worse enemies than you . ” “ Not just enemies , ” Cassiopeia replied .
“ I ’ ve seen your handiwork .
You ’ re not the only one who <unk> about in the dark . ” She spat a <unk> wad of venom as he turned toward the sound of her voice .
The man howled in pain , <unk> holes burning through his armor and into his skin .
She inhaled the satisfying <unk> of burning leather and flesh .
The man <unk> his sword .
“ Who are you ?
Why ’ re you doing this ? ” “ I ’ ve been watching you , ” replied Cassiopeia .
“ I know what you are , what you do … ” “ What I do is no business of yours . ” “ I know you ’ re <unk> children for <unk> meat .
I hear it ’ s quite <unk> . ” The man tried to <unk> open the shutters of a nearby window with the flat of his sword , but they too were bolted shut .
“ Then there ’ s the three tavern <unk> , ” said Cassiopeia .
“ <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
They were found in the river yesterday .
Their faces were hardly recognizable once you ’ d finished with them . ” She relished the thought of sinking her talons into his flesh .
The man readied his stance .
“ You can ’ t fight me from the shadows .
Show yourself ! ” “ <unk> well , ” Cassiopeia said .
She slithered down to the courtyard and rose to her full height .
The man ’ s eyes widened in horror , his hands trembling .
Cassiopeia stood head and shoulders over the man , glaring down with narrowing eyes .
“ Monster ! ” he cried .
“ Monster , ” murmured Cassiopeia .
“ Not the worst I ’ ve been called . ” She slid left and whipped her tail across his legs , effortlessly knocking him to the ground .
<unk> her tail around his chest , she squeezed his <unk> tighter and tighter , <unk> his pounding heart straining beneath her grasp .
She heard bones crack .
She resisted the urge to break him completely , and released her grip .
He crawled to his sword , grasping it in desperation .
She so enjoyed watching him tremble .
She circled him slowly .
He met her gaze and stared in slow recognition .
“ I know your face .
The Lady Cassiopeia ! ” he said .
“ Look at you ! ” Point to the ground , he pushed himself onto his feet with his sword .
“ You chase <unk> like me through the filthy <unk> of this city now , is that it ? ” The man spat a wad of blood .
“ From such great heights we fall , <unk> ? ” She hissed , exposing dripping yellow fangs .
Cassiopeia ’ s gaze bored into the man ’ s eyes , locking them in a <unk> bond .
She screamed , pouring all her rage into the cry ; fury at the <unk> of her current state , anger at the loss of her <unk> life , resentment for her failed ambitions .
She channeled it all into the screeching , <unk> wail .
As she screamed , her fury was replaced with joy .
It felt like she was floating , her potential for <unk> infinite .
Every fiber of her being sang with ancient power .
Searing emerald light blazed from Cassiopeia ’ s eyes .
The man ’ s final panic was <unk> in silhouette as he <unk> from the inside out .
His stare hardened , greyed , and stiffened , his last cry of terror <unk> as her curse transformed his flesh to stone .
Cassiopeia slithered up to the statue and softly caressed its hard cheek .
What was once skin fractured into a <unk> pattern <unk> a dried <unk> .
“ Once , I had to manipulate , <unk> , or otherwise … <unk> people to <unk> my <unk> , ” she said .
“ But now … Now I simply take what I want . ” She whipped her tail forward , smashing the statue to the ground .
She smiled , eyes glinting , as it shattered into a thousand pieces of rubble and dust .
Cassiopeia <unk> with pride as she considered her handiwork .
Her life as a noble was over , yes , but never had she felt such boundless power coursing through her veins .
She slithered back onto the rooftops , her mind awhirl with <unk> .
Her next victim would offer her a far greater challenge .
= = = = = = <unk> WORK = = = = = = = = UNKNOWN = = Night had always been Diana ’ s favorite time , even as a child .
It had been that way since she was old enough to <unk> over the walls of the Solari temple and watch the moon <unk> the vault of stars .
She looked up through the dense forest canopy , her violet eyes scanning for the silver moon , but seeing only its <unk> glow through the thick clouds and dark branches .
The trees were pressing in , black and <unk> , their branches like crooked limbs reaching for the sky .
She could no longer see the path , her route forward obscured by rank <unk> and grasping <unk> .
<unk> thorns scraped the curved plates of her armor , and Diana closed her eyes as she felt a memory stir within her .
A memory , yes , but not her own .
This was something else , something drawn from the fractured <unk> of the celestial essence that shared her flesh .
When she opened her eyes , a shimmering image of a forest <unk> the <unk> trees before her .
She saw the same trees , but from a different time , from when they were young and <unk> and the path between them was dappled with light and edged in <unk> .
<unk> in the harsh <unk> of Mount Targon , Diana had never seen a forest like this .
She knew what she was seeing was an echo of the past , but the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> were as real as anything she had <unk> .
“ Thank you , ” she whispered , following the spectral outline of the ancient path .
It led Diana through <unk> and withered trees that ought to have been long dead .
It climbed the slopes of rocky <unk> , and passed through stands of twisted pine and wild <unk> .
It crossed tumbling mountain <unk> and wound its way around sheer slopes before bringing her to a rocky plateau overlooking a vast lake of cold , dark water .
At the center of the plateau was a circle of towering stones , each carved with looping spirals and <unk> sigils .
On every stone Diana saw the same <unk> that shimmered upon her forehead and knew she had reached her destination .
Her skin <unk> with a sense of <unk> anticipation , a sensation she had come to associate with wild and dangerous magic .
<unk> now , she approached the circle , eyes scanning for threats .
Diana saw nothing , but she knew something was here , something utterly hostile and yet somehow familiar .
Diana moved to the center of the circle and drew her sword .
Its crescent blade glittered like diamond in the <unk> moonlight <unk> the clouds .
She knelt with her head bowed , the blade ’ s tip resting on the ground , its quillons at her cheeks .
She felt them before she saw them .
A sudden drop in pressure .
A raw charge to the air .
Diana surged to her feet as the <unk> between the stones split apart .
The air buckled and a trio of screeching beasts charged her with ferocious speed ; ivory flesh , bone-white <unk> of segmented armor and steel talons .
<unk> .
Diana dived beneath a snapping jaw filled with teeth like <unk> <unk> , slashing her sword in an overhead arc that clove the first monster ’ s skull to its heavy shoulders .
The creature fell , its flesh instantly <unk> .
She rolled to her feet as the others circled like pack hunters , now wary of her gleaming blade .
The creature she had killed now resembled a pool of <unk> <unk> .
They came at her again , one from each side .
Their flesh was already darkening to a bruised purple , hissing in this world ’ s hostile atmosphere .
Diana leapt over the <unk> beast and swung her sword in a crescent arc towards its neck plates .
She yelled one of the Lunari ’ s holy words and <unk> light blazed from the blade .
The beast blew apart from the inside , gobbets of <unk> flesh disintegrating before the moonblade ’ s power .
She landed and swayed aside from the last beast ’ s attack .
Not fast enough .
<unk> talons punched through the steel of her <unk> and dragged her around .
The beast ’ s chest split apart , revealing a <unk> mass of sense organs and hooked teeth .
It bit into the meat of her shoulder and Diana screamed as numbing cold spread from the wound .
She spun her sword , holding the grip like a dagger and rammed it into the beast ’ s body .
It screeched , <unk> its hold .
<unk> black ichor poured from its ruptured body .
Diana spun away , biting down on the pain racing around her body .
She held her moonblade out to the side as the clouds began to thin .
The beast had tasted her blood and hissed with predatory hunger .
Its armored form was now entirely <unk> black and <unk> purple .
Bladed arms unfolded and remade themselves in a <unk> of hooks and talons .
<unk> flesh flowed like <unk> to seal the awful wound her blade had ripped .
The essence within Diana surged .
It filled her thoughts with undying hatred from a distant <unk> .
She glimpsed ancient battles so terrible that entire <unk> had been lost in the fires of their <unk> ; a war that had almost unmade this very world and still might .
The creature charged Diana , its body rippling with the raw power of another realm of existence .
<unk> parted and a brilliant <unk> of silver speared downwards .
Diana ’ s sword drank in the radiance of distant moons and light burned along its edge .
She brought it down in an <unk> ’ s arc , cleaving plated bone and woven flesh with the power of the night ’ s <unk> .
The beast came apart in an explosive <unk> of light , its body utterly unmade by her blow .
Its flesh melted into the night , leaving Diana alone on the plateau , her chest heaving with <unk> as the power she had joined with on the mountain withdrew to the far reaches of her flesh .
She blinked away <unk> of a city that echoed with emptiness where once it had pulsed with life .
<unk> filled her , though she had never known this place , but even as she mourned it , the memory faded and she was Diana again .
The creatures were gone and the stones of the circle gleamed with threads of silver radiance .
<unk> from the touch of the hateful place on the other side of the veil , their healing power seeped into the earth .
Diana felt it spreading into the landscape , carried through rock and root to the very bones of the world .
“ This night ’ s work is done , ” she said .
“ The way is sealed . ” She turned to where the moon ’ s reflection shimmered in the waters of the lake .
It beckoned to her , its irresistible pull <unk> deep in her soul as it drew her ever onwards .
“ But there is always another night ’ s work , ” said Diana .
= = = = = = A GOOD <unk> = = = = = = = = MATT DUNN = = Magga was about to die for the <unk> time .
She had <unk> into a rotten <unk> – yet again .
Its putrid flesh had , as always , infected her with <unk> .
The actress went through the <unk> of <unk> to her death while shouting her final words for all to hear .
“ Oh , but how <unk> a dream is life ?
Only now — too late ! — do I wake to see its myriad of <unk> , ” she <unk> .
With a <unk> of smoke and glittering powder , Kindred made a grand entrance upon the stage .
As <unk> <unk> , they were played by one actor , his head covered by two <unk> masks .
He approached Magga , the white mask of the Lamb facing her .
“ <unk> !
Do I hear a plea for my keenest arrow ?
Come , child , let the warmth of your heart fade into the cold embrace of oblivion . ” Magga refused , as she had thirteen times before .
Any <unk> in her performance was buried beneath the <unk> <unk> of her scream .
On <unk> , Lamb spun around , revealing the second mask – that of the Wolf .
“ There is naught ye can do to <unk> off thine end , ” growled Wolf .
“ I am but a poor young maiden !
Please , let my piteous cry fall on all four of thine ears . ” The audience seemed <unk> by the <unk> dramatics of the Orphellum Mechanicals .
With the twin threats of plague and war on the tongues of those in neighboring <unk> , death <unk> were all the rage .
Denji , the actor <unk> both Lamb and Wolf , descended upon the young actress , awkwardly baring wooden fangs .
Magga offered her neck .
At the threat of Wolf ’ s bite , she <unk> the <unk> sewn into her <unk> ’ s collar .
<unk> of red fabric <unk> to the <unk> <unk> and <unk> of the audience .
They ’ d gotten what they <unk> for .
By the time the Mechanicals had staggered back to their wagon and set off in the direction of Needlebrook , there were no stars to be seen .
Instead , a veil of clouds stretched across the night sky .
Needlebrook always <unk> a good audience , Illusian , the company ’ s <unk> and sole <unk> , explained once more .
He staggered around , drunk on his own <unk> — as well as the wine Parr had <unk> from the locals .
The night wore on , and the troupe had descended into <unk> .
Tria and Denji <unk> their playwright over the quality of his plots , which fell into a <unk> structure : tragedy strikes maiden , death <unk> maiden , death takes maiden .
Illusian argued that <unk> plots <unk> from a good death scene .
Magga , the <unk> of the <unk> , agreed with Tria and Denji ’ s <unk> , but kept her mouth shut .
Had she not stowed away in the wandering troupe ’ s wagon , she would <unk> be somewhere far more miserable .
<unk> for her , the Mechanicals had recently lost several actors due to Illusian ’ s <unk> on complete <unk> control .
Because of his <unk> — and obvious <unk> — they were facing a <unk> of fresh faces .
And so , the Orphellum Mechanicals agreed to <unk> Magga to die in all their dramatics for the <unk> future .
For which she had been <unk> .
Illusian was still <unk> from Denji and Tria ’ s words when he <unk> to Parr , their <unk> , to stop and make camp .
The inebriated <unk> set out his bedroll in pride of place next to the wagon .
He then threw the rest of the bedding into the long grass nearby .
“ <unk> players can sleep in the wilds , ” Illusian spat , “ where they shall <unk> find their manners . ” The rest of the troupe built a fire and swapped stories .
Denji and Tria had fallen asleep in each other ’ s arms while whispering potential names for their <unk> child into each other ’ s ears .
They had <unk> on about the day the traveling company would stop in <unk> , a town so perfect and peaceful they would set aside their <unk> ways to raise their child .
Magga moved closer to the crackling fire so its <unk> and <unk> would drown out the <unk> <unk> of her traveling <unk> .
But sleep never came .
Instead , Magga tossed and turned , thinking about the looks on the audience ’ s faces as the coiled <unk> of blood unfurled from her <unk> .
A pretty maiden struck dead by her own <unk> was all the <unk> pomp Illusian could muster , but the crowd <unk> after the gruesome façade .
Eventually , she left her bedroll and set out into the woods to <unk> her <unk> mind .
In the dead of night , Magga came upon a low <unk> <unk> with slabs of standing stone at its base .
<unk> she could not read the inscriptions , her fingers traced the familiar <unk> of Kindred ’ s twin masks .
This was a place of the dead , a <unk> <unk> built long ago .
She felt a chill on the back of her neck that compelled her to look up .
She was not alone .
Magga immediately understood what she saw , for she ’ d encountered a crude <unk> of them night after night .
But poor Denji couldn ’ t begin to <unk> the dread washing over Magga .
Before her , perched on a weathered <unk> , was Lamb herself , flanked by her <unk> <unk> , Wolf .
“ I hear a beating heart ! ” said Wolf , his black eyes twinkling with delight .
“ May I have it ? ” “ Perhaps , ” replied Lamb .
“ I sense she is afraid .
Speak , beautiful one .
Tell us your name . ” “ I-I would have yours first , ” stammered Magga , stepping backward .
Her slow escape was <unk> by the speedy Wolf , who materialized <unk> close behind her .
He spoke directly in her ear .
“ We have many names . ” “ In the <unk> , I am <unk> to his <unk> , ” said Lamb .
“ In the <unk> , <unk> to his <unk> .
But we are Kindred everywhere .
I am always Lamb to Wolf , and he is always Wolf to Lamb . ” Wolf reared up and <unk> at the air .
“ She is playing a boring game , ” said Wolf .
“ Let us play a new game , one of chasing and running and biting . ” “ She is not playing , dear Wolf , ” said the Lamb .
“ She is frightened and has lost her own name .
It hides behind her lips , afraid to come out .
<unk> not , dear child , I have found your name .
We know it as you know us , Magga . ” “ <unk> , ” Magga stammered .
“ Tonight is not a very good night for — ” Wolf ’ s great pink tongue <unk> out of the side of his mouth , and he <unk> to <unk> .
“ All nights are good nights for pouncing , ” said Wolf , laughing .
“ All days are , too , ” Lamb said .
“ With light comes a clear shot . ” “ There is no moon tonight ! ” cried Magga .
She used what Illusian had taught her — to gesture grand , so those in the back could see her movements .
“ It is hidden by a blanket of clouds , tucked away from my eyes and yours .
Without the moon , what would be the last thing I would see ? ” “ We see the moon , ” replied Lamb , as she caressed her <unk> bow .
“ It is always there . ” “ There are no stars ! ” said Magga , trying again , this time gesturing smaller and speaking <unk> .
“ No <unk> of twinkling <unk> , glittering in the midnight hue .
What more beautiful view could one hope for whence one <unk> Lamb and Wolf ? ” “ This Magga-thing is playing a new game , ” growled Wolf .
“ It is called ‘ <unk> . ’ ” Wolf stopped moving and cocked his head to the side .
He turned his <unk> snout toward Magga before speaking .
“ Can we play ‘ <unk> the <unk> and <unk> Her to Bits ? ’ ? ” Wolf clacked his fangs together loudly for effect .
“ Let us ask her , ” said Lamb .
“ Magga !
Do you prefer Wolf ’ s chase , or my arrow ? ” Magga was trembling now .
Her eyes raced to take in every last detail of the world around her .
It wasn ’ t such a bad place to <unk> .
There was grass .
There were trees .
There was the ancient <unk> .
There was stillness to the air .
“ I would prefer Lamb ’ s arrow , ” she said , looking at the rough <unk> of bark on the trees .
“ I ’ ll imagine myself climbing to the <unk> <unk> , like when I was a child .
Only this time , I will never stop climbing .
Is that what it is like to go with you ? ” “ No , ” said Lamb , “ though it is a nice thought .
Fear not , little maiden , we are just having our <unk> .
You have come to us tonight ; we have not come for you . ” “ I cannot chase Magga-thing , ” said Wolf , with a hint of <unk> in his voice .
“ But there are other things nearby .
Other things ripe for the chasing and the biting .
Hurry , Lamb .
I am hungry . ” “ For now , know that your theatrics have pleased us , and we will watch them until the day we meet again . ” Wolf passed over Magga and disappeared into the woods .
The shadowy beast snaked away through fields of tall grass .
Magga looked back toward the weathered barrow .
Lamb was gone .
The actress fled .
When Magga returned to the encampment , she found it in utter ruin .
The wagon she had only just begun to call home had been <unk> and reduced to a smoldering husk .
Bits of <unk> and ruined <unk> lay <unk> across the <unk> .
She found Denji ’ s body near where he ’ d <unk> .
He had died protecting Tria , whose corpse lay behind him .
<unk> from the trails of blood , their deaths had not been slow .
They had dragged themselves toward each other , their fingers <unk> in one last <unk> before death .
Magga noticed that Illusian had managed to kill two of the <unk> before being burnt to a <unk> along with Parr in the wagon .
The only thing that remained untouched were Denji ’ s Lamb and Wolf masks .
Magga picked them up and held them in her hands .
She placed the Lamb mask over her own eyes and heard the voice of Wolf .
“ <unk> the Magga-thing . ” The maiden ran the distance to Needlebrook , never once looking back .
The Golden Round was filled to the <unk> with a sea of twinkling eyes , all glittering in excitement at the velvet curtain .
The king sat in the theater with the queen and their <unk> , all eagerly awaiting the <unk> of the dramatics .
Everyone hushed as the black curtain lifted to reveal the actors .
Magga sat in a quiet <unk> room under the stage .
She heard the crowd fall silent as she studied herself in the mirror .
The <unk> of youth had faded from her eyes years ago , and left her with a long shock of silver running through her hair .
“ <unk> ! ” said the stagehand .
“ You ’ re not in costume yet . ” “ No , child , ” Magga said , “ I only dress at the last moment . ” “ It is the last moment , ” said the young stagehand , holding the two final pieces of Magga ’ s costume : the same Lamb and Wolf masks from her days with the Orphellum Mechanicals .
“ May your performance be blessed tonight , ” the stagehand said .
Magga prepared to leave for the stage .
She slipped the masks over her head .
The old chill from the dark barrow crept down her spine .
She welcomed it — as always .
She <unk> the audience as she <unk> onto the stage , <unk> Lamb ’ s graceful movements .
She thrilled the crowd with her rendition of Wolf ’ s playful savagery .
She , as the twin deaths personified , eased the suffering of her fellow actors , or ripped it from their throats , until the crowd stood on its feet and erupted in thunderous applause .
It was true .
All <unk> loved a good death , and they loved Magga ’ s more than any other .
Even the king and queen were on their feet in <unk> of her work .
But Magga heard no applause and saw no <unk> .
She didn ’ t feel the stage beneath her feet , nor the hands of her fellow mummers in hers as they bowed low .
All she felt was a sharp pain in her chest .
When Magga looked out over the audience , every single face was either a lamb or a wolf .
= = = = = = <unk> FOR THE <unk> = = = = = = = = UNKNOWN = = The battle spilled over like a feast before them .
Such delicious life — so many to end , so many to hunt !
Wolf paced in the snow while Lamb danced <unk> from sword edge to spear tip , the <unk> <unk> never <unk> her pale coat .
“ There is courage and pain here , Wolf .
Many will gladly meet their end . ” She drew up her bow and let loose an arc of swift <unk> .
The last breath of a soldier came with a ragged <unk> as his shield gave way to a heavy axe .
<unk> in his heart was a single white arrow , shimmering with ethereal <unk> .
“ Courage <unk> me , ” the great black wolf <unk> as he tracked through the snow .
“ I am hungry and eager to chase . ” “ Patience , ” she murmured in his shaggy ear .
As soon as the words left her , Wolf ’ s shoulders tensed and his body dropped low to the ground .
“ I smell fear , ” he said , trembling with excitement .
Across the <unk> field of snow , a squire — too young for battle , but with blade in hand , nonetheless — saw that Kindred had marked all in the valley .
“ I want the <unk> .
Does it see us , Lamb ? ” “ Yes , but it must choose .
<unk> the Wolf , or embrace me . ” The battle turned its steel toward the squire .
He now stared at the roiling tide of <unk> and desperation coming for him .
This would be his last dawn .
In that instant , the boy made his choice .
He would not go willingly .
Until his last breath , he would run .
Wolf snapped in the air and rolled his face in the snow like a new <unk> .
“ Yes , dear Wolf . ” Lamb ’ s voice echoed like a string of <unk> bells .
“ <unk> your hunt . ” With that , Wolf <unk> across the field after the youth , a howl thundering through the valley .
His shadowed body swept over the remains of the newly dead and their useless , shattered weapons .
The squire turned and ran for the woods until thick black <unk> passed in a blur .
He pressed on , the frozen air burning his lungs .
He looked once more for his hunter , but could see nothing but the darkening trees .
The shadows closed <unk> around him and he suddenly realized there was no escape .
It was the black body of Wolf that was everywhere at once .
The chase was at its end .
Wolf buried his sharp teeth in the squire ’ s neck , tearing out <unk> of <unk> life .
Wolf reveled in the boy ’ s scream and crunching bones .
Lamb , who had trailed behind , laughed to see such sport .
Wolf turned and asked , in a voice more growl than speech , “ Is this music , Lamb ? ” “ It is to you , ” she answered .
“ Again , ” Wolf licked the last drop of the youth ’ s life from his <unk> jaws .
“ I want to chase again , little Lamb . ” “ There are always more , ” she whispered .
“ Until the day there is only Kindred . ” “ And then will you run from me ? ” Lamb turned back to the battle .
“ I would never run from you , dear Wolf . ” = = = = = = <unk> <unk> = = = = = = = = MATT DUNN = = Tarnold knew the performance was doomed when all his playwright ’ s tricks were exhausted .
His players were lost to performance <unk> .
Perhaps the <unk> was to blame , or the <unk> surrounding the performance of a dead scribe ’ s unfinished work , but each <unk> had succumbed to one form of <unk> or another .
Artlo , who played a character known only as the <unk> , wouldn ’ t stop dying .
Each time he <unk> his last breath in the company of that kindred pair of macabre spirits known as the Lamb and the Wolf , he <unk> his death rattles to the point of absurdity .
This time , Nenni had laughed so hard her Lamb ’ s mask fell off her face .
It landed on the ground with a loud crack .
Emile removed his Wolf ’ s mask .
Its sharp , jagged edges were <unk> his <unk> to <unk> .
He winced in pain — Tarnold knew he was about to ask for the <unk> again .
“ Stop ! ” Tarnold said .
He did not need to yell .
The Mummers ’ Round ’ s <unk> <unk> ensured even the <unk> , with their <unk> admission , could hear the <unk> sigh with clarity .
The old theater rested near the lord castellan ’ s <unk> and provided a nice glimpse of the dark forest .
On banquet nights like tonight , nobles descended from the castellan ’ s <unk> to drunkenly take in the mummers ’ theatrics .
A <unk> crowd of <unk> nobles was worse than the humiliation of a failed play .
The actors released their <unk> and turned to face their chief dramatist .
Tarnold rubbed the bridge of his nose with his fingers and looked to the wings , where a <unk> man , dressed in black <unk> , leaned against one of the story stones .
“ Duarte , ” Tarnold said to the <unk> man .
“ <unk> me as much time as you can . ” Duarte nodded in understanding .
“ I ’ ll hold the audience until I hear your sign . ” “ Do not <unk> us , even if Lady Erhyn herself <unk> off her malaise and demands a <unk> .
We are on the verge , Duarte .
We must fall together to rise together ! ” “ Rise we shall , Tarnold .
With the gust of life . ” Duarte kissed the palm of his hand and placed it on the story stone for good luck .
He disappeared from the stage and exited the theater .
Silence <unk> while everyone waited on the sound of the heavy bolt sliding shut .
Once they were sealed within the Mummers ’ Round ’ s walls , with the sun <unk> closer to the evening , Tarnold unleashed his temper .
“ Ask a Great City boy for water , and a Great City boy will bring you fire .
There is to be one death , and one death alone , Artlo . ” He turned to Nenni .
“ Stop laughing at Artlo ’ s <unk> , you daughter of <unk> .
<unk> off your <unk> <unk> and <unk> the cold <unk> of death . ” Finally , he pointed to Emile .
“ I can see your blood <unk> down your cheek .
<unk> your cheeks . ” “ Please , let me fix some <unk> to the inside of this <unk> wolf mask . ” “ <unk> through the pain !
Did Soates <unk> while writing her Kindred <unk> on her deathbed ?
No .
<unk> honored !
One of her own <unk> <unk> your cheek . ” “ This one doesn ’ t fit me , ” Nenni said .
She had picked her lamb mask up off the stage floor .
“ It keeps sliding off . ” “ Then use straps ! ” Tarnold said , pulling off his own belt to throw it at Nenni ’ s feet .
<unk> hours of rehearsals had done nothing to prepare the troupe for the performance of Soates ’ final , unfinished story .
Part of that , Tarnold had accepted as his own fault .
As the chief dramatist of <unk> ’ s greatest — and only — theater , the grim task of finishing her story fell to him .
“ Lambs in the Orchard was Soates ’ final <unk> of madness .
The very last of her spark is here , in our hands ... and you all choose to <unk> her memory , picking at it for your own <unk> and comfort .
She spent her final moments <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> .
Had death not stilled her hand while writing this very scene , perhaps we would all have a far greater understanding of our own brief and <unk> existence ! ” The actors remained silent , <unk> even , until Artlo cleared his throat and spoke up .
“ With respect , ” the gangly Demacian started .
Tarnold knew Artlo meant the opposite , and rolled his eyes to show it .
“ Perhaps an unfinished work is simply not meant to be finished by another . ” Tarnold sensed an attack on his <unk> .
They had had this argument over and again .
“ Are you <unk> that this <unk> is a work of <unk> ? ” “ We seem unable to <unk> the emotions of a master writing against time . ” “ Are you mad ?
We are out of time ! ” Tarnold pointed to the dwindling rays of sunlight piercing the wooden walls of the theater .
A <unk> sensation swept through him .
“ Perhaps , we perform the bits we know and leave the unfinished <unk> .
Is that not a better way to honor Soates ?
You must <unk> , Tarnold , this , ” Artlo said , pointing around himself , “ does not work ! ” Artlo was right .
They had failed to recreate the spark found in the <unk> bard ’ s other <unk> .
Their <unk> patron , a Soates <unk> , expected the impossible — an ending to an unfinished work .
In desperation , Tarnold had <unk> Duarte to travel to King Jarvan II ’ s Great City to the west , and hunt down the bard ’ s original masks .
They were ancient and <unk> <unk> .
Tarnold ’ s head slumped , his shoulders followed , and then he was on his back , struggling to breathe .
His heart raced against the <unk> hour .
“ We have to <unk> the performance . ” He rubbed his forehead , trying to <unk> out some last shred of luck , but finding only sweat .
“ <unk> , we ’ ll be forced to offer <unk> . ” He gasped out .
“ We already spent the gold ! ” “ It ’ s probably not a good time to mention that the lamb mask is broken . ” The color drained from Tarnold ’ s face .
“ What ? ” “ When it fell off my face , it broke .
It was an accident ! ” Nenni held the pieces of the mask in her hand .
One of the wooden ears had snapped off .
“ I think I can <unk> it back together . ” “ This is utterly majestic . ” Tarnold almost laughed .
“ That ’ s what we spent the gold on .
They were Soates ’ original masks .
They ’ re on <unk> ! ” “ She said it was an accident , ” said Emile .
“ Let me think . ” Tarnold stood up to take in the theater .
Its <unk> round had existed for centuries .
The story stones were the <unk> of the Mummers ’ Round .
The circle of towering flagstones had stood in the theater ’ s <unk> long before anyone settled the <unk> .
Over the years , wooden <unk> <unk> were <unk> to allow more a better view of the theatrics and rituals performed inside the round .
<unk> and <unk> notched the <unk> with their sigils , leaving their mark upon hallowed grounds .
The theater had been home to Tarnold during many difficult times .
Now , under his <unk> , it was the source of all his sorrows .
“ A broken mask tells two stories , ” said a voice from the middle balcony , reserved for the <unk> nobles .
Even in his <unk> moments , Tarnold dared not rest his head on those fine cushions .
“ Three , if you consider the tale of the <unk> ... <unk> , no one wishes to hear that story . ” “ We agreed for no visitors during rehearsals ! ” Tarnold said to his <unk> .
“ She ’ s been here all night , ” Nenni said .
“ We thought she was with you . ” Had she ?
It was possible .
Tarnold had <unk> <unk> for weeks .
His attention snapped to the woman in the golden seats , which were reserved for the Lady Erhyn herself .
Two summers ago , King Jarvan II ’ s little heir had sat upon those velvet cushions to enjoy Tarnold ’ s rendition of The King of All <unk> .
The boy had <unk> <unk> as the final curtain fell .
“ Who are you ? ” Tarnold said .
“ Step into the light . ” The woman came forward , but the light illuminated little of her mystery .
Her eyes were distant stars shining through mist .
She wore a ghostly <unk> with a curious <unk> of a <unk> <unk> off the top .
Upon that <unk> was a single dark leaf .
Her <unk> <unk> sang of nobility , and Tarnold finally recognized the <unk> on her gown .
It was their patron , recovered from her malaise .
“ My lady Erhyn , I did not recognize you !
Please forgive me . ” Tarnold offered a <unk> bow .
“ Tell me , what mask is this that <unk> your face ?
It is familiar yet beyond memory . ” “ It is made of eldlock . ” She spoke in a calm voice .
Her words were clear , even as she whispered .
“ The stories tell that any wood removed from an eldlock will continue to <unk> and flower in season with its <unk> , as long as it still stands .
No distance may <unk> their bond . ” “ It is <unk> , my lady . ” “ I have interrupted , ” Lady Erhyn said , gesturing to the actors .
“ Perhaps I could <unk> a change . ” “ Why , of course ! ” Tarnold <unk> with his hands .
He looked to the wings , and to the stage .
The mummers were keeping their mouths shut , for once .
“ <unk> from our favorite patron is always welcome . ” “ All actors were masked in Soates ’ day — perhaps all must don masks to channel the strange spirits she saw at death ’ s door , as she <unk> <unk> into the night ’ s embrace . ” “ I like that ! ” Artlo said .
“ Where is the <unk> of masks ?
There were others in that trunk , ” he called as he vanished behind the stage .
“ Now , wait , let ’ s talk this — ” Tarnold was silenced by the sight of the gaunt lady with the eldlock mask <unk> her hands together .
There was something off about their <unk> .
Before Tarnold could put his finger on it , Artlo returned <unk> , dragging a trunk that was as long as he was tall .
The name <unk> <unk> Soates was engraved on its long side .
Suddenly , it struck Tarnold how much the old trunk resembled a <unk> .
Artlo lifted open the heavy trunk ’ s <unk> .
“ <unk> like dead poets , ” he said .
The man really has no taste , Tarnold thought .
A heavy <unk> of rusted hinges reverberated through the round like the howl of a starving dog .
The other two actors <unk> their <unk> to peer inside .
“ Before you choose , ” the woman in the eldlock mask said .
“ Please heed these next words wisely .
The hour is late , the show waits to play , and tonight can be truly <unk> if all choose the mask that is right for them , for the spirits we become ... ” “ ... Inhabit us , ” Emile <unk> .
“ The mummers ’ <unk> , ” Nenni said .
“ Whatever flavor of madness this is , ” Artlo said , a grin spreading on his face , “ I want to be a part of it .
Come , Tarnold .
Even you must <unk> that at this late stage , we must perform with the gust of life . ” “ <unk> , ” the lady said .
Tarnold heard the hint of a strange smile on her face .
He couldn ’ t remember ... had the nobles ’ balcony not been empty when Duarte left ?
The whole theater was empty ... Lady Erhyn struck him as different now , too .
She seemed gaunt and haunted .
Perhaps the noble lady Erhyn hadn ’ t entirely <unk> off her <unk> .
The evening chill was settling in .
“ My lady , I am most pleased at your <unk> .
Perhaps I can fetch you a cloak ? ” “ Now , this is the mask to honor a forgotten <unk> , ” Artlo said .
Lady Erhyn waved off Tarnold ’ s offer , turning to Artlo .
“ An <unk> choice .
The Vulture picks at what remains , and when nothing is left ... it flies on to <unk> far removed from here and waits for the next <unk> . ” “ <unk> at Soates ’ legacy sounds like a feast . ” Artlo turned around and showed off his <unk> : a bone-white mask with a long , hooked beak .
The gangly man resembled a carrion bird .
The gaunt lady approached the stage .
She seemed so ancient , yet <unk> and graceful in her moves .
Her skin did not look like flesh .
It reminded Tarnold of <unk> , after it had been set and <unk> .
Her hair was the very night itself , radiating outward in a wavering embrace .
He felt as if the breath were stabbed out of his lungs .
How could he have ever <unk> the two ?
“ You ’ re not Lady Erhyn . ” The actors were oblivious to Tarnold ’ s <unk> .
A <unk> <unk> descended upon his heart .
Its beating pulsed loudly in his ears , nearly drowning out the actors ’ words .
“ <unk> masks with me , ” Nenni said to Emile .
“ Your soft skin can ’ t wear such a handsome mask .
My skin ’ s weathered worse , I ’ ll reckon . ” “ If you want to wear that <unk> thing ... ” Emile offered the wolf mask to his stage <unk> .
“ I mourn for your lovely cheekbones . ” The two slipped on their swapped masks .
The walls whispered as a gust of wind swept over the Mummers ’ Round .
Shutters clacked shut .
Tarnold heard voices in that swift and swirling breeze .
“ <unk> , Lamb .
Here , ” a deep voice growled .
Tarnold looked for the source , but could only see his mummers .
They seemed to have forgotten all about him .
Then , in his left ear , sang another voice .
“ Bits of light , <unk> in the dark , <unk> on , playing on , playing on ... ” The words flew through Tarnold with a jolt .
On the stage , he saw Nenni and Emile , hand in hand , wearing each other ’ s masks .
Then he saw the <unk> words were coming from the actors ’ mouths .
“ Yes , ” Emile said , shifting his voice up to a lilting and haunted <unk> .
“ I see my <unk> Wolf now . ” “ <unk> . ” Nenni let out a <unk> growl , her voice guttural and deep .
“ That feels better , little Lamb . ” The actor dropped down on all <unk> , and stretched lower than a human should be able to .
“ Is it time to play chase ? ” “ When the veil lifts , You shall claw and bite , My arrow swift , and on to the next act we go . ” Tarnold crossed the round , keeping his eyes fixed on the gaunt lady .
“ What trickery is this ?
Please , leave us be ! ” The woman turned to Tarnold .
“ I am not your patron , ” she said .
Tarnold looked to his masked actors .
“ All of you , clear the stage .
Go home .
The performance is over . ” He raised his voice , shouting toward the <unk> entrance .
“ Duarte ! ” “ Tarnold ... ” The woman who was not Lady Erhyn turned and looked at him with the enormity of her vast , <unk> eyes .
Even behind the eldlock mask , they shone with a light born of darkness .
Their eerie <unk> pulled Tarnold ’ s attention out of his body .
<unk> this was , he knew her and did not ; feared her and sought her .
Running from her felt foolish , and <unk> .
Without <unk> to , he walked toward the stage .
“ Take the masks off , ” he said .
“ Now .
This is madness ...
This play is cursed !
Don ’ t you see ?
What if , in the <unk> , Soates did not happen to die while writing the play , the act of writing Lambs in the Orchard was itself what killed her ...
The <unk> itself is a curse ! ” It was not the gaunt lady , Nenni ’ s wolf nor Emile ’ s lamb that replied .
Artlo , or whatever spoke through Artlo , answered in a screeching voice .
He spread his arms high and stood upon one leg , like a carrion bird .
“ The author waits for my beak , ” he said .
The corners of his lips cracked and split open .
“ Soates is truly dead ... as none remember her now as she once was . ” Tears ran down Artlo ’ s stretched cheeks .
The voice stilled Tarnold ’ s heart and stopped him in his stride .
“ Soates flies in my wake , soon lost and forgotten .
<unk> on a page .
A name on the wind .
Shreds ... nothing more . ” “ Shreds of Soates is still Soates , ” said the gaunt lady .
“ He ceased the performance ... ” Whatever spoke through poor Artlo didn ’ t care how much pain it caused the man ’ s body .
The actor ’ s arm violently wrenched forward and stretched , its <unk> hand pointing an <unk> finger at Tarnold .
“ And he <unk> no mask ... ” “ You are so close to Soates , ” the woman said to the dramatist .
“ <unk> a mask , and see her final scene come alive . ” He thought about running from the Mummers ’ Round .
He pictured himself fleeing up to the lord castellan ’ s <unk> on the hill , or into town .
What would he find in Lady Erhyn ’ s house ?
He looked to the gaunt woman .
The sun had almost set .
The evening cacophony of insects and night birds <unk> out their <unk> to the coming night .
How many nights had he <unk> of Soates ’ final moments , of the final scene ... “ Everyone must wear a mask , ” the woman said .
<unk> <unk> , Tarnold nodded in agreement with the woman in the eldlock mask , that dark leaf dancing in an <unk> breeze .
“ If I must choose a mask , then I <unk> , I know the one I would <unk> is not in that trunk , nor is it on the stage . ” He felt life return to his limbs .
His bones were <unk> and <unk> ... but that was a temporary condition .
The gaunt woman smiled .
“ You wish to wear my mask ?
That is a most <unk> decision , dear Tarnold , a man of <unk> and curiosity .
Come and <unk> it from my face . ” “ I shall take your mask , and become you .
May the spirits we become ... ” “ ... Inhabit us deeply and truly , ” she finished .
When Tarnold did , and placed the living eldlock mask on his face , he saw , finally , the true ending of Soates ’ play .
It was <unk> and terrible , <unk> and <unk> .
“ <unk> , my friends and fellows , ” he said .
“ Our tale waits for no one .
Let us fall together to rise as one , and sing our <unk> with the gust of life . ” “ One last gust , ” replied Lamb , Wolf , and Vulture .
And together , they played .
Duarte had kept the news about Lady Erhyn hidden from Tarnold all day , even though the truth of her passing threatened to burst forth from his lips .
Her malaise carried her off in kindred company before dawn , or so the new lady of House Erhyn had said .
The news could break the <unk> of the entire troupe .
Tarnold , he knew , would take it <unk> hard .
But just as sorrow weighed down Duarte ’ s heart , there was a <unk> , an <unk> turn of good fortune beyond the tragedy .
Lady Erhyn , on her deathbed , <unk> her <unk> to <unk> the Mummers ’ Round , and Tarnold <unk> , in <unk> .
<unk> , as the hour drew later , the inebriated nobles grew weary of the wait .
<unk> and <unk> nobility often led to <unk> , <unk> , and worse : <unk> against future <unk> .
As Duarte was about to <unk> the <unk> <unk> , <unk> with ashes and <unk> in mourning of Lady Erhyn , he heard Tarnold ’ s <unk> to open the doors .
He rushed to the gate and removed the heavy <unk> .
The audience rushed in and stopped short as they found the actors <unk> upon a stage covered in wilted <unk> roses .
Their <unk> anticipation was hushed by the macabre tableau .
They quickly and quietly found their seats .
Lady Erhyn ’ s <unk> of honor was the only empty spot in the house .
The actors held their <unk> <unk> while the noble audience waited for Soates ’ long-lost and unfinished masterpiece to finally begin .
Duarte saw no sign of Tarnold .
It was unusual for the dramatist to desert his cast on opening night — <unk> he would <unk> the audience before watching from the wings with a bottle of wine .
He turned to inspect the opening stance .
Nenni and Emile were locked in a mortal embrace .
Nenni , wearing the wolf mask , held an arrow that seemed to stick directly into Emile ’ s side .
Emile ’ s hands were wrapped around Nenni ’ s throat .
Artlo , who was supposed to be playing a <unk> , now <unk> wore a mask that resembled a dirge crow .
He perched atop a <unk> tree , suspended over the other pair , his arms outstretched like great wings .
Dead flowers hung from his arms like feathers .
They weren ’ t even breathing ...
The audience stayed silent , eagerly awaiting action , but Duarte realized something was amiss .
<unk> , Duarte <unk> the dramatist ’ s favorite <unk> .
There was no bottle of wine , and no Tarnold , either .
Instead there was the last <unk> <unk> of Lambs in the Orchard .
He <unk> to the last page .
The story remained unfinished , but there was a new line written in Tarnold ’ s steady hand .
The end is not for those who wear no masks .
She showed me , and it was beautiful .
= = = = = = <unk> <unk> <unk> = = = = = = = = UNKNOWN = = The sea was <unk> and dark .
A <unk> ’ s moon hung low on the horizon as it had for the last six nights .
Not so much as a whisper of wind stirred the air , only that damned dirge carried from who knew where .
Vionax had sailed the oceans around Noxus long enough to know that seas like this only ever <unk> ill-fortune .
She stood on the Darkwill ’ s <unk> , training her <unk> on the far ocean , searching for anything she could use to <unk> their <unk> .
“ Nothing but sea in all directions , ” she said to the night .
“ No land in sight and no stars I recognize .
Our sails are empty of wind .
The <unk> decks have rowed for days , but no matter which way we turn , land never comes and the moon neither <unk> nor wanes . ” She took a moment to <unk> the heels of her palms against her face .
<unk> and hunger growled in her belly and the constant darkness had made it impossible to <unk> <unk> the passage of time .
The Darkwill wasn ’ t even her ship .
She ’ d been it ’ s first <unk> until a Freljordian <unk> ’ s axe had split Captain <unk> ’ s skull and given her a sudden <unk> .
The captain and fifteen other Noxian warriors were laid within <unk> hammocks on the main deck .
The growing stench rising from the bodies was the only <unk> measure of time ’ s passing .
She lifted her gaze to the open ocean and her eyes widened as she saw thick black mist rising from the water .
Shapes moved in the mist , lambent <unk> of clawed arms and <unk> mouths .
That damned dirge rang out over the water again , louder now and accompanied by the <unk> <unk> of a funeral <unk> .
“ The Black Mist , ” she said .
“ All hands on deck ! ” She turned and vaulted down to the main deck , running for the <unk> and the ship ’ s <unk> .
Not that she could do anything to move the ship , but she ’ d be damned if she ’ d be found anywhere else .
A <unk> <unk> for lost souls drifted over the ship as men stumbled from below decks , and even as terror shivered her spine , Vionax couldn ’ t deny the <unk> in the sound .
Tears <unk> her eyes and ran down her cheeks , not in fear , but from infinite sadness .
“ Let me end your grief . ” The voice in her head was cold and lifeless , the voice of a dead man .
It <unk> the image of <unk> <unk> on a <unk> <unk> , a knife cutting yet another death mark on a staff .
Vionax knew the tales of the Black Mist ; she knew to avoid the islands <unk> beneath the darkness in the east .
She ’ d thought the ship was far from the Shadow Isles , but she was wrong .
She pulled up short as black mist boiled up over the gunwale , bringing with it howls and <unk> of dead things .
Wraiths spun overhead , a swirling chorus of the damned , and the Darkwill ’ s crew cried out in terror at the sight of them .
Vionax drew her pistol and cocked the hammer as a figure loomed from the mist ; towering and <unk> , robed in tattered vestments like an ancient <unk> , yet his shoulders and gaunt skull were armored as a warrior .
A chained book hung at his waist and he carried a long staff with its haft notched by countless <unk> .
<unk> light shone at its tip and burned like a fallen <unk> in the palm of his free hand .
“ Why do you cry ? ” said the creature .
“ I am Karthus , and I bring you a great gift . ” “ I don ’ t want your gift , ” said Vionax , pulling the <unk> .
Her pistol boomed and fire exploded from the barrel .
The shot struck the monstrous wraith , but passed through it without harm .
“ You mortals , ” said Karthus , shaking his <unk> head .
“ You fear what you do not understand and would turn away from a <unk> that is <unk> offered . ” The monster drifted closer , and the dark radiance of his staff bathed the ship ’ s deck in pale , sickly light .
Vionax backed away from the wraith ’ s chill as her crew fell before the light , their souls drifting like <unk> from their bodies .
Her heel caught on one of the laid out hammocks and she tripped , falling backwards onto her <unk> .
She pushed herself away from Karthus , <unk> over the bodies of her fellow sailors .
The <unk> beneath her moved .
They were all moving , <unk> and writhing like <unk> fish gasping for air at the bottom of a boat .
Tendrils of mist rose from tears in the canvas and between the rough <unk> the ship ’ s sailmaker had used to <unk> them shut .
<unk> moved in the mist , faces she ’ d sailed with for years , men and women she ’ d fought beside .
The wraith towered over her and the dead crew of the Darkwill stood beside him , their spirit forms limned in moonlight .
“ Death is nothing to be feared , <unk> Vionax , ” said Karthus .
“ It will free you from all your pain .
It will lift your eyes from your <unk> existence and show you the glory of life eternal .
Embrace the beauty and wonder of death .
Let go of your <unk> .
You do not need it . ” He held his hand out and the light there swelled to <unk> her .
She screamed as it pressed through her skin , into muscle , through bone , down to her very soul .
The wraith clenched his fist and Vionax cried out as she felt herself being <unk> from the inside out .
“ Let your soul fly free , ” said Karthus , turning to carve another <unk> in his staff with a sharpened nail .
“ You shall feel no pain , no fear , no desire to feel anything but the beauty of what I have to show you .
<unk> and wonders <unk> , mortal .
Why would you not <unk> such <unk> ... ? ” “ No , ” she said with her last breath .
“ I don ’ t want to see . ” “ It is already done , ” said Karthus .
= = = = = = THE <unk> = = = = = = = = <unk> HEIDE = = A horrible scraping of metal chains drifted over the fields .
<unk> , an unnatural fog rendered the moon and stars all but <unk> , and the <unk> hum of insects fell silent .
Thresh approached a ruined <unk> .
He raised his lantern , not to see his surroundings , but to look inside the glass .
The interior of the lantern resembled a <unk> <unk> with its thousands of tiny green glowing orbs .
They <unk> frantically as if trying to escape Thresh ’ s gaze .
His mouth twisted in a grotesque grin , teeth glinting from the glow .
Each of the lights was precious to him .
Behind the door , a man <unk> .
Thresh sensed his pain , and was drawn to it .
He knew the man ’ s suffering like an old friend .
Thresh had only appeared to the man once , decades ago , but since then the spectre had taken everyone the man held dear : from his favorite horse to his mother , brother , and recently a <unk> who had become a close <unk> .
The specter made no <unk> of natural deaths ; he wanted the man to know who caused each loss .
The spirit passed through the door , scraping his chains as they dragged behind him .
The walls were damp and <unk> with years of <unk> .
The man looked even worse : his hair long and matted , his skin covered in <unk> - angry and raw from clawing .
He wore what had once been fine velvet clothes , but were now little more than torn , tattered <unk> .
The man <unk> from the sudden green glow , covering his eyes .
He shook violently , backing away into the corner .
“ Please .
Please , not you , ” he whispered .
“ Long ago , I claimed you as mine . ” Thresh ’ s voice creaked and stretched , as if he had not spoken for an age .
“ It is time I collect ... ” “ I am dying , ” the man said , his voice barely audible .
“ If you ’ re here to kill me , you ’ d best <unk> . ” He made an effort to look at Thresh directly .
Thresh stretched his mouth wide .
“ Your death is not my desire . ” He set the glass door of his lantern slightly <unk> .
<unk> sounds came from within - a cacophony of screams .
The man did not react , not at first .
So many screams emerged that they <unk> together like scraping glass shards .
But his eyes widened in horror as he heard voices he recognized <unk> from Thresh ’ s lantern .
He heard his mother , his brother , his friend , and finally the sound he <unk> most : his children , wailing as if being burned alive .
“ What have you done ? ” he screamed .
He scrambled for something to throw - a broken chair - and threw it at Thresh with all his strength .
It passed through the spectre harmlessly , and Thresh laughed <unk> .
The man ran at Thresh , eyes wild with fury .
The spectre ’ s hooked chains whipped out like striking snakes .
The <unk> hooks struck the mortal ’ s chest , cracking <unk> and piercing his heart .
The man fell to his knees , face twisted in delicious agony .
“ I left them to keep them safe , ” the man cried .
Blood <unk> from his mouth .
Thresh wrenched his chains hard .
For a moment , the man did not move .
Then the ripping began .
Like a <unk> sheet being slowly torn , he was <unk> pulled from himself .
His body <unk> violently , and blood sprayed along the walls .
“ Now , we begin , ” said Thresh .
He pulled the <unk> soul , <unk> brightly from the end of the chain , and trapped him within the lantern .
The man ’ s hollow corpse collapsed as Thresh <unk> .
Thresh followed the curling Black Mist away from the <unk> with his glowing lantern held high .
Only after Thresh was gone , and the fog dissipated , did the insects <unk> their <unk> chorus and stars once again filled the night sky .
= = = = = = <unk> = = = = = = = = <unk> <unk> = = Senna woke with a gasp , her breath <unk> in the frigid night .
<unk> with sweat , her arms , legs , neck , and back were covered in a <unk> of sand .
A single thought tumbled through her mind .
You need to reach Bilgewater .
She sat up , and saw the dark waters of the Holnek streaming past the lonely <unk> .
Her instincts were pulling at her again , speaking to her as they had since childhood .
She had learned long ago to trust those feelings and <unk> — and now they were telling her to leave .
Lucian stirred in his sleep .
He turned and pulled their bedroll away , leaving her bare .
A gentle breeze <unk> her skin even more , and she burrowed her <unk> in the sand , searching for warmth .
There was an unusual ebb in Harrowings , and so they had <unk> north , to <unk> Valoran , <unk> <unk> until they neared the Noxian border .
The pair had spent a short respite together in <unk> , far from the storm that was their lives , a chance to <unk> one another after years of being apart .
It was <unk> , like a <unk> cloak .
Her instincts were ripping her away from the only refuge she and Lucian had known since they were <unk> .
She swallowed the knot growing in her throat , and closed her eyes , searching her heart , hoping that she had misunderstood , that her instincts weren ’ t so cruel , that they could be <unk> with .
But the feeling remained .
She stared at the vast darkness and felt the glare of countless stars — each one like a wretched soul waiting for <unk> , watching in silence as she lived the life they were denied .
She had no right to <unk> salvation , these precious moments spent with Lucian .
He ’ ll understand .
Lucian moaned softly in his sleep , head resting on a <unk> tome .
His breath quickened as he tossed beneath the bedroll , the moans growing louder .
Senna shook his shoulder until he <unk> awake .
He pushed himself up on his elbow , breathing heavily .
As he <unk> to the waking world , he stared at her , through her , still seeing the woman from his nightmare , the one he failed to save from Thresh ’ s lantern , her years of imprisonment and torture .
He took another deep breath , and relief settled in his eyes .
“ <unk> , ” he said , offering her the bedroll .
They watched the horizon .
A radiant edge of purple and <unk> heralded the approaching dawn .
You need to tell him .
Reluctantly , Senna turned to Lucian .
“ It ’ s time to go . ” “ We were just getting settled in , ” he said , still looking out across the water .
He let out a heavy sigh .
“ Where to ? ” “ Bilgewater . ” He shook his head .
“ If there ’ s a Harrowing , it ’ ll be over before we ever reach port . ” There ’ s still time .
“ If we leave now , we could be there in a few days , ” Senna said .
“ There ’ ll be nothing to do but bury the dead . ” Senna tensed at the <unk> of his words , the easy disregard of their duty as Sentinels of Light .
But she knew it wasn ’ t that simple — his feelings ran deeper , and his <unk> would be <unk> .
“ There ’ s still a chance , ” she <unk> .
“ I can feel it . ” Lucian said nothing .
His heart is elsewhere .
She looked at the codex lying on the sand , its bronze <unk> broken and <unk> with age .
“ Perhaps we shouldn ’ t have come this far north , ” she said .
“ It was <unk> . ” The ancient <unk> was Lucian ’ s latest <unk> , and the reason they had <unk> sailed to the <unk> .
He had <unk> it in <unk> , hoping it would reveal a way to end her curse , to free her of the Black Mist that had <unk> her <unk> since childhood — drawn to a spark of unnatural life that had infected her when she <unk> with a force she didn ’ t understand .
There were dozens of such volumes on their ship .
She ’ d often <unk> at night , alone in their bedroll .
She , shrouded in darkness .
He , illuminated by candlelight , hunched over a tome , desperately seeking answers to questions she had long stopped asking .
Lucian finally turned to Senna .
“ There <unk> ’ t been a Harrowing in months , ” he said .
The warmth had returned to his face , along with a <unk> of remorse .
“ I wanted us to rest , if only for a while . ” A piece of Senna ’ s heart wanted nothing more .
She <unk> to <unk> the horrors of the Black Mist , to look up at the night sky and see only stars .
“ I know , ” she said .
“ We both did . ” Lucian picked up the heavy codex and started to rise .
Senna felt the chasm widen between them , leaving her alone on the other side .
She took his hand , holding him fast .
“ We ’ ll start after dawn , ” she said .
He sat back down on the sand , and they watched the sunrise .
They had broken camp <unk> after dawn .
Senna was hauling the last of their provisions up a narrow <unk> while Lucian <unk> the <unk> , preparing to <unk> the <unk> .
They worked in silence , each lost in their own thoughts as the ship swayed in the calm waters of the Holnek .
She <unk> a wooden <unk> on the weathered deck , next to their other supplies .
Their stores had dwindled during their stay .
“ We ’ ll need to <unk> before heading to Bilgewater . ” Lucian nodded .
“ We can sail down the coast and <unk> in <unk> , but we ’ ll also need to anchor at <unk> . ” She gave him a curious look .
“ There ’ s a <unk> in the <unk> <unk> that works with silver <unk> , ” he said .
“ We ’ ll lose at least half a day in port . ” “ If we ’ re headed into a Harrowing , Thresh will be there , ” he said , eyes cold and flat .
Senna gazed at the deep waters of the river , its current flowing gently toward the sea .
Her gut feelings were leading her to Bilgewater , but something didn ’ t seem quite right .
“ The mist has been reaching out <unk> with each storm , like it ’ s searching for something , ” she said .
“ Why return to Bilgewater ? ” “ Those islands are his favorite <unk> . ” “ This is bigger than Thresh , ” she said , more sharply than she intended .
Lucian didn ’ t respond .
Instead , he opened his <unk> , took a long drink of water , and then slowly pushed the <unk> back inside .
“ He ’ s constantly <unk> , ” he finally said .
“ And all the other spirits are trapped in their suffering .
Who knows what <unk> <unk> what ’ s left of their minds ? ” He looked away , jaw clenched , lips pressed into a rigid line .
Senna thought of the chaotic patchwork of <unk> and lengths of twine that stretched across the walls in their cabin .
Lucian had used them to track the Black Mist for years while she was <unk> in the lantern .
He can ’ t see past his hatred .
Senna shook her head .
It was more than just anger .
Lucian <unk> the mist as a horrific <unk> upon the world , a <unk> of wraiths needing to be <unk> .
But her time in the lantern had shown her a different way .
She could use her powers to <unk> those wretched souls , <unk> them from suffering .
“ The Ruined King is behind these Harrowings .
There ’ s <unk> there ... an <unk> , ” she said .
“ I can feel it .
He ’ s — ” Something ’ s wrong !
A light flashed in the east .
Lucian opened his mouth to speak , but his words drowned before they reached Senna ’ s ears .
Her legs weakened as an overwhelming weight pressed against her chest .
She lunged for the ship ’ s <unk> but found Lucian ’ s hand instead .
Dark lightning slammed into Senna .
The jolt sent her crashing against the deck , every limb contorted in searing pain , her body <unk> and twisting as bones threatened to snap .
A chorus of screams breached her mind .
The anguished cries <unk> and swelled until the world shattered in fragments of blinding light .
She felt herself being torn away from Lucian and the boat and the shore , and the anchor that held her life in place .
<unk> laughter ushered in the silence .
Ash fell gently on Senna ’ s face .
She cracked open her eyes , <unk> as she saw <unk> of dark lightning crawling down her arms .
<unk> screams still resonated in her mind .
Slowly , her thoughts cleared , and the arcs of energy dissipated .
Only the echo of laughter remained .
No .
No .
No ... Something ’ s wrong ... You need to get up .
She struggled to a knee , braced her arm on her leg , and rose in a <unk> of ash and cinders .
<unk> , thick and <unk> , rushed past her face like heat from an open furnace , the <unk> of a burning world on her tongue .
She <unk> on <unk> clay — the ship had disappeared , leaving her alone on a plain of <unk> mud that stretched across a desolate wasteland , veiled in a haze .
A <unk> of mountains towered in the distance , their fiery crowns spewing smoke into the <unk> sky .
Senna was back in the lantern .
<unk> rose in her chest , hammering her heart and hitching her breath .
She clutched her hands to ease their trembling , and inhaled deeply .
You ’ re wrong .
This can ’ t be the lantern .
But she had seen this before , or something <unk> : scorched <unk> , frozen <unk> , <unk> streets in chaotic <unk> .
The landscape perpetually changed and warped in the spectral prison , as <unk> as its tortures .
No , this is something else .
Senna shook away the doubt and squeezed her eyes shut .
“ Do not deny this truth , ” she whispered to herself .
“ Not again . ” In the early days of her imprisonment , she had wasted precious months , perhaps years , unable to accept her own death , trapped in a cycle of misery and loneliness .
She wouldn ’ t <unk> that mistake .
She had escaped once — she would do so again .
Her eyes opened , and she looked for a way out .
A scream sounded from somewhere far away .
Senna called to the Black Mist , but drew smoke and embers instead .
The poor <unk> rushed in , <unk> her into a wraith , shrouded by death .
She moved , and the world blurred in a <unk> of color , <unk> shifting rapidly as the landscape changed .
She stopped with a jolt , and Bilgewater snapped into place .
But it wasn ’ t the Bilgewater she knew .
The harbor lay ruined , overrun by a massive Harrowing .
<unk> timber , <unk> stonework , the bones of <unk> leviathans , all <unk> into twisted <unk> .
The warped amalgamations floated in midair among the broken hulls of ravaged ships and hundreds of charnel <unk> once <unk> in the sea .
A fortune in <unk> drifted amid the debris , glittering like ghostly stars .
Senna released the darkness , and her body returned , the <unk> planks of the <unk> <unk> beneath her weight .
She walked along the <unk> and came across the wreckage of a hunting vessel run <unk> , its <unk> prow <unk> the remains of a <unk> tavern .
A figure stood at the center of the destruction .
It was a statue of a woman , its arms raised in <unk> , mottled face frozen in terror .
Senna felt a strange familiarity , like a <unk> dream , and a <unk> of sorrow poured over her .
Hand quivering , she reached out and lightly brushed the statue ’ s cheek .
The face collapsed , and the entire figure began to break apart .
Slowly at first , and then all at once , the stone woman crumbled into a heap of ash .
He found her !
An unfamiliar fear swelled inside Senna , <unk> her to take flight .
She pushed it away .
Of course he had found her , whoever she was .
There was no hiding from Thresh ; this was his domain .
She had witnessed countless tortures , each soul an endless opportunity for the Chain Warden to delight in their suffering .
Senna regarded the pile of ash .
This isn ’ t Thresh .
It didn ’ t feel quite right .
In all her years in the lantern , she had never encountered anything like this .
Perhaps he had refined his <unk> .
If there was one constant , it was his pursuit of <unk> misery .
She looked out at the dark waters of Bilgewater Bay .
The fiery mountain <unk> loomed from afar , <unk> the horizon .
She knew this to be <unk> , a <unk> of the lantern .
There were no mountains south of Bilgewater .
She would have had to sail around — A stray thought flitted through her mind .
She reached for it , grabbed it , and turned it over .
The vault unlocked , releasing a memory .
She had been going to Bilgewater — no , they had been going to Bilgewater .
Lucian !
He would be fighting out there , desperate to free her from the lantern , suffering alone , as he had for years .
It had almost broken him .
Senna ’ s consciousness reached out across the great expanse .
She smiled , feeling Lucian ’ s love nearby .
But there was something else , <unk> and urgent .
It was panic .
She had felt it in Lucian only once before — when Thresh had killed her .
Pushing away her <unk> dread , she narrowed her focus and spoke .
“ Lucian ... I ’ m here . ” Silence .
She tried again , and again , and again , every attempt <unk> the same <unk> — Lucian remained unmoved by her call .
In the past , she had been able to <unk> with him from within the lantern , but Thresh must have found a way to <unk> her voice .
Her body trembled in desperation and fury .
She shut her eyes , whispering the mantras she ’ d learned long ago .
“ Carve away the unwanted .
Keep only the stone .
Carve away the unwanted .
Keep only the stone . ” She opened her eyes with renewed determination .
Thresh hadn ’ t beaten her yet .
The rules of <unk> didn ’ t <unk> in the lantern .
The ancient relic was an <unk> realm crafted for suffering .
It appeared <unk> vast , but Senna knew the truth — she had discovered the lantern ’ s <unk> and pressed against its walls , feeling its <unk> .
As she studied the sky , her stomach <unk> .
This isn ’ t the lantern .
She paused , reflecting again on those early days and the hard <unk> she had come to accept .
She <unk> the <unk> and continued searching .
Dark plumes erupted from the fiery peaks , sending black tendrils of soot to <unk> the sky .
She needed to pierce the <unk> veil .
<unk> smoke and embers into her , she transformed once again , and Bilgewater blurred away as she took to the heavens .
Senna flew across the ocean , <unk> ever higher .
But the mountains rose up as well , rumbling and spewing vapor in her path .
She <unk> to avoid the <unk> clouds , but the blazing peaks <unk> course with her , ever present and <unk> .
Darkness spread across the horizon — a great fog threatening to consume all in its path .
<unk> to evade the shifting <unk> , she plunged into the gloom .
A storm roared around her , the wailing of countless souls pushing against her like a <unk> .
This isn ’ t the way .
You need to turn back .
Hand outstretched , she pressed even higher .
A light flickered beyond her fingertips , and her doubts faded as she sought the edge of the lantern .
The light <unk> brighter and suddenly snapped at her fingers .
She pulled back her hand , but the sting was already flaring into searing pain , <unk> her spectral form .
Dark energy surged and leashed her in midair .
Senna fell from the sky .
She awoke on <unk> dirt .
Her human form had returned , an aching , knotted <unk> covered in a dusting of cinders and ash .
She rolled onto her back , groaning and <unk> as arcs of lightning crackled down her clammy flesh .
They dissipated , leaving behind a <unk> numbness .
<unk> torture was foreign to the lantern .
Thresh rarely <unk> to such <unk> forms of suffering .
The mind and soul were <unk> fields to plant seeds of torment .
Perhaps this was her punishment for <unk> .
And yet , it still felt wrong .
You need to get up !
She staggered to a knee , but her leg gave under her weight , and she crumpled back to the ground .
The world <unk> as clouds stretched across the sky , pushing away the last remaining color .
You need to fight ... You ’ re dying !
Senna laughed at the absurdity of the thought .
There were <unk> worse than death .
She had endured them for years — she would bear them again .
But as the shadows grew , she began to fear what was in store for her this time .
Her brief taste of freedom would make her captivity more desolate , her loneliness and <unk> greater than before .
And then , she had an even more <unk> thought .
No !
Don ’ t think that !
Perhaps she had never escaped .
What if she had watched Lucian suffer defeat after defeat , and her broken mind had imagined a different <unk> , one that lifted her from this pit of misery ?
Perhaps her escape had been nothing but a <unk> .
As realization flared , Senna wailed , a primal sound filled with rage and despair .
No .
She hadn ’ t created this <unk> — it was made by Thresh .
It ’ s not true !
She shook her head , <unk> for clinging to false hope .
You need to get up !
“ No , ” she said , clutching her temples .
You need to fight !
“ No , he ’ s won .
This was his plan . ” If you stay here , you ’ ll die !
“ I ’ m already dead ! ” she screamed .
“ I ’ m just a dead thing that ’ s cursed ! ” Her voice broke , along with something inside .
She folded over , curling herself up to become small .
Her cries of grief echoed through the great expanse .
It wasn ’ t meant to be a curse , Senna .
What I gave you was a gift .
Senna bolted upright .
The words had been heavy and sharp , piercing her mind like a dagger .
They weren ’ t her own .
She swayed on her feet , <unk> the numbness in her legs .
“ <unk> out of my head , ” she said .
“ Do you hear me , Thresh ?
! ” No laughter .
No admission .
Nothing .
The mountains had receded , their fiery peaks muted in gray .
Senna stood alone among the falling embers .
<unk> crackled on her skin , bolts <unk> down her body .
“ Is that all you have , Chain Warden ? ” she asked through gritted teeth .
“ You ’ ve lost your touch . ” I ’ m not the Warden , sweet Senna .
But I ’ ve also known his tortures .
The voice was <unk> and <unk> and resonated with fragile <unk> .
Senna had met others in the lantern , <unk> with them over their shared loneliness and suffering .
Perhaps ... “ Who are you ? ” Silence , and then ... A friend .
Someone who can help you get back to Lucian .
Bitterness rose in Senna ’ s throat .
“ How do you know that name ? ” I know your whole life .
I ’ m here to help , but you ’ ll need to trust me .
“ You ’ re here to offer hope ? ” She laughed , but there was no humor in it .
“ I was wrong .
You haven ’ t lost your touch .
It ’ s more refined . ” Senna whirled around , searching for the specter .
“ Your games are done , Chain Warden , ” she said .
“ The cycle is broken .
Here and now .
Show yourself ! ” The world unfurled and changed , revealing clear skies over white sands and an emerald sea .
Waves <unk> at her feet , her <unk> , her knees .
She cast her gaze inland and gasped .
Beyond a ridge of white dunes sat a dense <unk> , its <unk> trees native to her island .
Senna was home .
She heard a soft <unk> coming from beneath the canopy , <unk> memories of her mother singing by the <unk> .
Senna held her breath , watching as a young girl exited the <unk> , <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
She recognized the child — it was her .
The girl <unk> toward the shore , <unk> dunes with a carved walking stick .
A cold <unk> washed over Senna .
This was the <unk> morning .
The day everything changed .
By evening , her <unk> would be lost .
She took a step toward the girl .
It ’ s only a memory , Senna .
You can ’ t change anything .
“ Then why bring me here ?
Is this another trick ? ” There ’ s something I need you to see .
The girl ’ s eyes <unk> .
She bent down and plucked a seashell from the sand .
<unk> fingers caressed the pink husk before placing it in a pocket — one of dozens on her <unk> legs , each sewn by her mother , in different <unk> and patterns , to hold the countless <unk> she found .
The girl turned toward Senna and smiled .
Senna hesitated , then offered a <unk> wave .
She can ’ t see you .
The girl dashed at Senna , but then at the last moment , she <unk> and splashed into the water next to her .
Senna whirled , and dread knotted her stomach .
A shipwreck was washing <unk> .
The girl <unk> inside a dark hollow in the broken hull with her staff , <unk> she had “ <unk> of <unk> ” .
She giggled at the words , convinced their power gave her claim to the ship ’ s bounty .
Hands <unk> with sweat , Senna <unk> with the urge to <unk> the girl and run .
From her <unk> point , she saw the danger the child did not — a tendril of Black Mist stirring in the wreckage .
“ She doesn ’ t know of the darkness she ’ s about to unleash on all the people she loves , ” she said .
But Senna ’ s <unk> also revealed something she hadn ’ t seen before .
As the mist uncoiled and sought to prey on the child , beneath the water , a glowing sphere approached , its filaments of light breaking the surface , searching .
The sphere flitted toward the girl and seeped into her spine .
The girl stiffened for a moment , eyes wide with fear and confusion .
Do you remember what happened next ?
“ I-I sensed the danger before I saw it ... My mind was screaming ... A voice was telling me to run . ” The girl flung her wooden staff at the dark tendril , and bolted into the woods .
Senna grew <unk> , <unk> the warning that saved her life .
“ But it wasn ’ t my voice .
It was yours . ” The water stirred at Senna ’ s feet as a trio of <unk> filaments rose from the sea .
They turned and twisted , <unk> together into a brilliant silhouette of hallowed light that gradually formed into the spirit of a young woman .
The radiance washed away the <unk> of her face , leaving only an <unk> of kindness and love .
A rush of sorrow and joy overwhelmed Senna , like waters from a broken <unk> .
“ The attack wasn ’ t your fault , ” said the spirit .
She spoke with her true voice and not through Senna ’ s mind .
“ You were alive .
And that ’ s the one thing the Black Mist cannot <unk> , for it <unk> all life . ” The words lifted a weight Senna had carried all her life .
<unk> , she was able to see the moment in a different way .
“ I should ’ ve died on that beach .
I ’ d be another wraith , screaming in the mist , if you hadn ’ t warned me . ” She paused to consider .
“ Why did you help me ? ” The spirit ’ s thoughts seemed to go far away , and although her face remained <unk> behind the hallowed light , Senna saw the hint of a smile on her lips .
“ I was a girl once , playing with dolls , singing as I made believe . ” She fixed her gaze on Senna .
“ Life should be <unk> . ” “ But you stayed <unk> , ” Senna said , her voice shaking .
“ All these years , the Black Mist wasn ’ t drawn to me — it was you .
The unnatural life .
You ’ re the curse . ” “ If I could have <unk> you that pain ... ripped myself out ...
I would have .
I tried for years , but I didn ’ t know how . ” The spirit turned and looked down at the water .
“ And then ... to watch you grow , from that frightened girl into this fierce woman , a Sentinel of Light fighting back the mist — I had to see it through . ” Senna arranged the pieces .
That first night .
Her village .
Her home .
All those loves swept away in dark waves .
The chasm between her and those who survived .
The fear in their eyes .
Years spent running in terror .
Losing people who tried to protect her .
Losing Urias , her mentor .
The walls she ’ d built to guard against the horror and the guilt , believing she had brought the curse upon herself .
“ I was a little girl — if I had known the truth ... ” “ It was best that I didn ’ t interfere , ” the spirit said , <unk> her ghostly hands .
“ To learn you were conjoined to some unwelcome <unk> , it would have <unk> you of your own heart . ” “ But you did interfere , ” Senna shot back .
“ The itch down my spine .
The <unk> of my gut .
Even the whispers in my mind .
It ’ s always been you ! ” The spirit hung her head in shame .
“ I was only helping you ... when it was <unk> . ” “ Help ?
Is that what that was ?
All these years , you let me suffer alone ! ” Senna hardened , venom <unk> her voice .
“ Why reveal yourself now ? ” The spirit met Senna ’ s glare , her eyes tender but <unk> .
“ You were never alone , Senna .
I just couldn ’ t reach you through the veil , until now . ” The world shifted once again , as the white sands and emerald sea were <unk> away by a <unk> wind .
The pair remained on the island , but now the waters raged , and the mountains towered much closer than before .
Ash rained down .
Senna thought about these new <unk> , as well as the <unk> she had made in the lantern , secrets learned from other fallen Sentinels .
This spirit ’ s presence had marked her , leading her down a path to death and captivity .
But that unnatural life had also kept her alive in the lantern , <unk> her to escape .
And now , it was still helping her .
She knew in her bones that her life was tied to this spirit .
Senna had many questions and lingering resentment , but she let them burn away like dying embers .
<unk> was the only thing that mattered .
“ You ’ ve been warning me that this isn ’ t the lantern , ” she said , watching the waves crash against the shore .
“ This is all in my mind , isn ’ t it ? ” “ Yes .
But the threat is very real .
It was Thresh ’ s powers that struck you down , ” said the spirit .
“ His reach <unk> across the world , but Bilgewater is his goal for now . ” “ Then he ’ s the key .
Lucian was right . ” “ The Warden is of <unk> .
But his <unk> only helped set things into motion ... for him , ” she said , motioning toward the horizon .
Senna followed the spirit ’ s gesture to the mountain peaks .
They rumbled across the ocean , pouring out thick <unk> of darkness .
“ You ’ ve seen him in catacombs , and temples , and distant shores . ” The spirit smiled <unk> .
“ Trust your instincts . ” “ What does he want ? ” “ To possess what is no longer his , ” she said , the softness gone from her voice , the hallowed light flaring with her words .
“ He ’ s a child with a bitter heart , who would rather make the world share his misery than face it alone . ” “ How do we stop him ? ” “ You ’ re the best hope .
The years of training , the powers you wield , even your time in the lantern , all helped you become a <unk> weapon . ” The spirit looked away , eyes <unk> with remorse .
“ I ’ ll be with you , every step of the way ...
Yet I fear , in the end , it may take all we have . ” Senna simply nodded .
“ I ’ ve lived .
I ’ ve fought .
I ’ ve died .
And still , I feel the warmth of Lucian ’ s arms , even now , ” she said .
“ This curse is a gift . ” She had come to accept it , even if Lucian had not .
<unk> her shoulders , she turned her attention back to the mission .
“ Can we make it to Bilgewater in time ? ” The spirit seemed to <unk> the question .
“ The attack is already under — ” Before she could finish , the spirit ’ s form tensed with fear .
<unk> of dark light spiked through Senna , driving her to one knee .
She gasped for air as color drained from the sky .
The heavens pressed in , and the world collapsed into a cavern of swirling <unk> .
Every blistering jolt narrowed the cave even more — <unk> it would become her <unk> .
Senna twisted , fighting the <unk> of her body , and looked to the spirit .
The apparition was folded over , writhing , trembling , sharing in the misery .
Lightning pulsed across her ghostly form , searing away her hallowed light .
“ What ... is ... this ? ” Senna wheezed .
“ Thresh ... His attack is still destroying your body ... You must drive out his power . ” Senna focused on the dark energy , bound it with her own light , and pushed it away as she would the Black Mist .
It flowed out in a steady stream .
But as it reached the <unk> point , the power resisted and rushed back in , <unk> her in pain .
She crumpled to the ground .
Her strength was rapidly fading , but underneath her dwindling light , she felt an <unk> <unk> of radiant power .
It belonged to the spirit .
“ You say I ’ m never alone ?
Then prove it ! ” Senna grabbed the woman ’ s spectral hand .
“ <unk> your light and <unk> it to my own . ” She turned toward Senna , though it looked painful to do so .
“ I ’ ve never — ” “ Don ’ t worry , I ’ ll help you , ” she said , forcing a smile through the agony .
Together , they channeled their light and pushed against the dark energy .
They met resistance , but only for a moment , and then the nightmare exploded in a blinding flash of white .
Senna woke with a gasp .
She sat up , dark lightning still erupting from her chest .
It dissipated in the cool morning air , and she collapsed in Lucian ’ s arms .
“ No , Senna ... Not again , please ... ” Lucian ’ s voice <unk> , his body shuddering as he held fast .
“ It ’ s — it ’ s passed ... I ’ m okay . ” She waited for a moment , feeling his heartbeat gradually slow , his trembling <unk> .
Then she gently pulled away .
“ What is that ? ” Lucian asked , confusion and fear in his eyes .
A faint light glowed in her chest .
Senna remained perfectly still , until the light faded away .
She waited , listening , feeling , hoping for the slightest hint .
“ Are you still there ? ” she finally asked , her voice <unk> .
“ Yes , ” said Lucian and the spirit , in her mind and in her ear .
Senna exhaled and smiled .
Lucian was staring at her , nodding , searching for answers .
She met his gaze , and said , “ We need to get to Bilgewater — something terrible has happened . ” He was about to speak , to rattle off a <unk> of questions , but she reached for his hand .
“ I ’ ll explain what I can , but we need to leave , now . ” Lucian sighed , a heavy and <unk> sound , but he helped her to her feet and prepared to <unk> .
The ship gently creaked and swayed on the river , tugging against its anchor , ready to set sail .
Senna looked toward the east , breathing in the new day , sunlight shimmering off the water .
For the first time in a long time , she didn ’ t feel alone .
= = = = = = THE <unk> <unk> <unk> = = = = = = = = ANTHONY REYNOLDS = = Blood pooled beneath him , bright crimson against pristine white stone .
His sword lay nearby , its blade broken .
His killers stood around him , shadows on the periphery , but he saw nothing except her .
Her eyes stared into his own , without seeing .
His blood-spattered face was reflected back at him .
He was lying on his side .
His breath was shallow , and weakening .
Her lifeless hand was cold , but he didn ’ t feel anything .
A calmness descended upon him like a shroud .
There was no pain , no fear , no doubt .
Not any more .
His armored fingers tightened around her hand .
He couldn ’ t be with her in life , but he would be with her in death .
For the first time in what seemed forever , he felt at peace … “ <unk> , Ledros , ” said a voice that shouldn ’ t be there .
Ledros … His name .
There was an evil , mocking laugh , and a <unk> of chains .
“ I don ’ t know why you do this to yourself , but I have enjoyed seeing you suffer . ” Reality crashed over him like a tidal wave , threatening to drag him under .
The blood beneath him was centuries old , <unk> and brown .
The stone was not white , but black , and cracked .
The sky was filled with <unk> , dark clouds lit from within by lightning .
And everywhere , the Black Mist coiled .
She was still there for a moment , and he clung to her , <unk> to let her go .
“ My love , ” he breathed , but then she faded , like ash on the wind , and he was left grasping at nothing .
He was dead .
And he was trapped here in this <unk> <unk> .
Ledros rose , and picked up the shattered remnant of his sword .
He leveled the ghostly blade at the one who had shattered the illusion of his memory .
The hateful spirit lurked in darkness , <unk> at him , eyes burning with cold flame .
His cursed lantern sat on a smashed <unk> of <unk> nearby , radiating beams of deadlight , captive souls writhing within .
The Chain Warden .
Thresh .
Oh , how he hated him .
The cursed spirit had haunted him for what seemed like centuries , <unk> him , mocking him .
Now he had found his way here ?
This was his sanctuary , the only place he could feel even a fleeting moment of peace before the horror of his reality <unk> itself .
“ Why are you here ? ” Ledros demanded .
His voice was dull and hollow , as if he spoke from distance or time far away .
“ You were lost for quite a while this time , ” said Thresh .
“ <unk> .
Perhaps years .
I don ’ t keep track any more . ” Ledros lowered his blade , and took <unk> of his surroundings .
He remembered this place as it had been — white stone and shining gold bathed in sunlight .
<unk> white mist had wreathed the isles , <unk> <unk> .
When they had first landed , it seemed a land beloved by the gods — a place of wealth , and knowledge , and wonder , untouched by <unk> or war .
It had just made it <unk> .
There had been little resistance .
Now there was no sun .
All was darkness .
The ruptured , shattered <unk> of the <unk> loomed above , like some great , desiccated corpse .
<unk> of stonework hung in mid-air , where they ’ d been blasted outward and locked in time .
He had been a fool to think the gods had loved this place , for they had clearly <unk> it .
Every time he <unk> from the unformed madness of the Black Mist and reformed , it was here , where his mortal body had fallen , so long ago .
Every time it was the same .
Nothing changed .
The one waiting for him was new , however .
It was not a change he welcomed .
Out of <unk> , he reached for the pendant he always wore around his neck … but it was not there .
“ No … ” The <unk> glowing within him flared brightly in rising panic .
“ Such a pretty trinket , ” said Thresh .
Ledros ’ head snapped around , eyes blazing .
Thresh held aloft a short chain , from which hung a delicate silver pendant engraved with two roses , their leaves and stalks wrapped around each other like a <unk> ’ embrace .
<unk> surged within Ledros , hot and sudden , and his sword flared as he took a step toward Thresh .
He ’ d been a big man in life , full of wrath and violence — the king ’ s <unk> , no less .
He towered over Thresh .
“ That … is … mine , ” hissed Ledros .
The Chain Warden did not flee before him like the lesser spirits did .
The death ’ s head that was his face was hard to read , but there was cruel amusement in his eyes .
“ You ’ re an <unk> , Ledros , ” he said , still dangling the pendant before him .
“ Some might say we all are , but you ’ re different .
You stand out .
Here , you are the real <unk> . ” “ Give it to me , ” snarled Ledros , blade at the ready .
“ I will cut you down . ” “ You could try , ” said Thresh .
He spoke <unk> , but his eyes burned , eager for violence .
He sighed .
“ But this gets us <unk> .
Here .
Take it .
It means nothing to me . ” He tossed it away with a <unk> <unk> .
Ledros caught it in one black gauntlet , his arm snapping out with a speed that <unk> his size .
He opened his massive fist , <unk> the pendant .
It was <unk> .
Ledros sheathed his blade and removed his spiked helm .
His face was insubstantial , a ghostly echo of how he had appeared in life .
A cold wind whipped across the blasted landscape , but he didn ’ t feel it .
He pulled the precious pendant over his head , and slipped his <unk> back on .
“ Don ’ t you ever wish to see an end to this vile existence , Chain Warden ? ” Ledros said .
“ To finally be at peace ? ” Thresh shook his head , laughing .
“ We have what mortals have <unk> since time <unk> — eternity . ” “ It makes us <unk> . ” Thresh smirked , and turned away , the chains and hooks hanging from his belt clinking .
His lantern drifted along beside him , though he didn ’ t so much as touch it .
“ You cling so desperately to the past , even as it <unk> through your fingers , like sand in a <unk> , ” said Thresh , “ yet you ’ re blind to the wonder of what we have been given .
It has made us gods . ” “ It is a curse , ” hissed Ledros .
“ Run along then , <unk> , ” Thresh said , gesturing Ledros away , <unk> .
“ Go , find your <unk> .
Perhaps this time she ’ ll even remember you … ” Ledros became very still , eyes narrowing .
“ Tell me something , ” said Thresh .
“ You seek to save her , but from what ?
She does not seem tormented .
You , however … ” “ You walk a dangerous line , warden , ” snarled Ledros .
“ Is it for her sake you do this ?
Or your own ? ” Thresh had said words to this effect before .
He seemed intent on making a mockery of Ledros ’ efforts .
“ I am not one of your <unk> , warden , ” Ledros said .
“ Do not make the mistake of thinking you can toy with me . ” Thresh smiled , exposing the <unk> teeth of a predator .
“ Of course not , ” he said .
With a gesture , Thresh called his lantern .
It came to him , swiftly , then hovered just below his outstretched taloned hand .
In the lantern ’ s glowing deadlight , Ledros saw anguished faces , pressing against their <unk> , before fading to be replaced by others — a horrific cavalcade of tormented souls .
Thresh smiled , <unk> their pain .
“ I don ’ t need to torture you , ” he said .
“ You do that to yourself . ” The Chain Warden stepped into the darkness , leaving Ledros utterly alone .
A hollow wind ripped through the shattered city , but he did not feel it .
He felt nothing but her .
She was hunting .
Ledros stepped into the mist , letting it flow around him .
Then he shifted through it .
The Black Mist writhed around him , full of hate , anger , and fear , but he remained <unk> from it , <unk> his sense of self .
He was drawn toward her like a <unk> to candlelight , and just as <unk> of the danger .
He whipped across what had once been the <unk> Isles , passing over wasted lands and the churning water of the <unk> <unk> them .
Wherever the Black Mist extended — reaching <unk> , searching , always searching — he was able to go .
This was their <unk> prison .
Her burning presence within the darkness <unk> him on .
She was close .
<unk> the <unk> of her , he stepped from the mist once more .
He stood in a blackened forest , the trees withered and dead , their branches dry and cracked .
The echoes of leaves long since fallen rippled in the memory of a breeze far more gentle than the cold gale now howling through the dead forest .
He sensed movement in the trees .
His heavy boots crunched on blackened soil as he began to stalk it .
His iron shield was strapped to his left arm , though he didn ’ t remember securing it there , and he drew his sword .
The leather wrapped around its hilt had rotted long ago , and while the blade was broken a few feet above the hilt , the ghostly outline of its full length could still be seen , glowing softly .
<unk> and <unk> by the <unk> of time , it was a shadow of its former majesty .
It had been <unk> to him by the king himself , back when his <unk> was a man to be <unk> and loved .
The ground <unk> sharply below , but he kept to the high ground , moving along a ridge marked with <unk> stone and twisted roots .
He could see them now — shadowy spirits borne upon spectral steeds , galloping through the <unk> below .
They moved swiftly , weaving between the trees , east toward a sun that would never again rise over these shores .
They moved as one , like a hunting party … yet they were the ones being hunted .
Ledros broke into a run , keeping pace with them .
A voice echoed through the trees .
“ We come for you , betrayers … ” It spoke not as a single voice , but rather a score or more of them , <unk> and overlapping , a legion of souls speaking as one .
The strongest of them was one he knew well .
Ledros quickened his pace , running fast and low .
The riders below had been forced to <unk> around massive stone <unk> and the <unk> of ancient , desiccated trees .
It slowed them , while the ridge he ran was straight .
He quickly <unk> them and drew ahead of the hunted spirits .
Ledros turned abruptly , stepping over the edge of a sheer cliff .
He landed in a <unk> at the base , some thirty feet below , the earth cracking beneath him .
He stood within a narrow <unk> , where the natural <unk> of the land had created a <unk> .
The riders would have to come through .
With blade drawn , he waited .
The first of the horsemen appeared , riding at a gallop , a being of spirit and twisted metal — a vile mockery of the <unk> knights of the Iron Order .
They were nothing to him now , just hateful fragments of the men they had once been .
A dark lance , its tip jagged and hooked , was clasped in the knight ’ s mailed grip , and great curling horns extended from his helm .
<unk> Ledros , he wrenched his mount violently to the side , making it <unk> and spit .
Its hooves were wreathed in shadow , and it seemed not to touch the ground at all .
Had Ledros killed this one before ?
Or had he been one of those that had survived his <unk> , and killed him ?
The other riders appeared , pulling their steeds up short .
“ <unk> aside , <unk> , ” one hissed .
“ We have no quarrel with you , ” said another .
“ Our quarrel will last until the end of time itself , ” growled Ledros .
“ So be it , ” snarled another of the deathly knights .
“ <unk> him down ! ” “ You shouldn ’ t have stopped , ” said Ledros , a smirk playing on his lips .
“ That was an error . ” One of the knights was hurled from his saddle , a glowing spear impaling him .
His steed turned to smoke as he hit the ground .
The knight screamed as he followed it into nothingness , condemned to join the Black Mist once more .
No spirit went to that darkness willingly .
“ She ’ s here ! ” roared the lead rider , dragging his steed around to face the new threat .
There was confusion among the others , caught somewhere between the desire to turn and fight , and to flee in panic .
They ’ d have been better off taking their chances at riding him down .
At least a few might have escaped .
Against her , all would be returned to the mist .
Another knight was ripped from the saddle , a spear hurled from the mist taking him in the chest .
Then she appeared , loping from the gloom like a <unk> on the hunt , her eyes burning with predatory light .
Kalista .
Ledros ’ gaze was instantly drawn to the ethereal <unk> protruding from her back , and he felt a <unk> in the core of his being , as sharp as the blades that had ended his own life .
Kalista <unk> forward , a spectral spear clasped in one hand .
A knight charged her , <unk> lance lowered , but she rolled lightly out of the way .
Coming to one knee , she hurled her spear , impaling the knight as he rode past .
Even as she threw , she was moving toward her next enemy .
She flexed her hand , and a new weapon materialized in her grasp .
A sword flashed down at her , but Kalista <unk> it <unk> , slapping the blade aside with the haft of her spear , before swaying away from the flailing hooves of the knight ’ s steed .
<unk> from a blackened rock , she twisted in the air and drove her spear down into the rider ’ s chest , banishing him to darkness .
She landed in perfect balance , eyes locked to her next victim .
Ledros had never met a woman as strong as Kalista in life .
In death , she was unstoppable .
<unk> the others focused on her , two of the knights charged Ledros , <unk> seeking to escape Kalista ’ s <unk> slaughter .
<unk> <unk> at the last moment , Ledros slammed his heavy shield into the steed of the first , knocking the spectral beast to the ground , legs kicking , and sending its rider <unk> from the saddle .
The lance of the second knight took Ledros in the side , punching through his armor and snapping halfway down its length .
<unk> , Ledros <unk> his feet and spun , lashing out with his blade .
He struck through the neck of the knight ’ s steed , a blow that would have <unk> the beast had it been made of flesh and bone .
Instead , it exploded into nothing with a keening scream .
Its rider crashed to the ground .
Ledros smashed the ghostly warrior backward with a heavy blow of his shield as he rose , <unk> him onto the point of Kalista ’ s spear .
Her hunt , her kill .
Ledros sheathed his blade , and watched as she destroyed the last of the spirits .
<unk> and lean , Kalista was in constant motion .
Her enemies had been <unk> <unk> whose skill at arms was <unk> , yet she moved among them effortlessly , <unk> lance <unk> and sword strikes , <unk> each in turn .
Then it was done , and the only two left standing were Kalista and Ledros .
“ Kalista ? ” he said .
She turned her gaze upon him , but there was no hint of recognition in her eyes .
Her expression was stern , as it ever had been in life .
She regarded him coldly , unblinking .
“ We are the Spear of Vengeance , ” she replied in that voice that was not hers alone .
“ You are Kalista , Spear of the <unk> <unk> , ” said Ledros .
He knew the words she would speak next before she even opened her mouth .
It was the same every time .
“ We are retribution , ” said Kalista .
“ Speak your pledge , or <unk> . ” “ You were <unk> to the king I served in life , ” said Ledros .
“ We are … <unk> with each other . ” Kalista regarded him for a moment , then she turned and strode away .
“ Our task is unfinished , ” she said , without looking back .
“ The betrayers will suffer our wrath . ” “ Your task can never be finished , ” said Ledros , <unk> to keep pace .
“ You are trapped in a never-ending spiral !
I am here to help you . ” “ The guilty shall be <unk> , ” said Kalista , continuing to march back through the trees .
“ You remember this , don ’ t you ? ” said Ledros , drawing the pendant from around his neck .
That gave her <unk> , as it always did .
It was the one thing Ledros had discovered that could break through her <unk> , even if only for a moment .
He just needed to figure out how to <unk> that moment … Kalista came to a halt , <unk> her head to one side as she looked at the delicate pendant .
She reached for it , but stopped herself before she touched it .
“ I tried to give this to you once , ” said Ledros .
“ You refused it . ” <unk> touched her eyes .
“ We … I … remember , ” she said .
She looked at him — actually saw him .
“ Ledros , ” she said .
Her voice was her own now , and for a moment she was the woman he remembered .
The woman he ’ d loved .
Her features softened , ever so slightly .
“ I could never have given you what you wanted . ” “ I understand , ” said Ledros , “ even if I didn ’ t at the time . ” Kalista looked around , as if only now <unk> aware of her surroundings .
She looked at her hands , glowing from within and as insubstantial as smoke .
Ledros saw confusion , then anguish play across her face .
Then her features hardened .
“ Would that I had never brought him here , ” said Kalista .
“ All this could have been <unk> . ” “ It was not your fault , ” said Ledros .
“ I knew madness had claimed him .
I could have ended it before it came to this .
No one would have <unk> his death .
No one would have mourned him . ” “ He wasn ’ t always that way , ” said Kalista .
“ No , but the man we knew died long before all this , ” Ledros said , gesturing around him .
“ … We have a task to complete . ” Hope stirred within him .
It was an unfamiliar feeling .
“ Whatever it is , we will complete it together , just as … ” he said , but his words <unk> out as he realized his error .
The cold mask had dropped over her features , and she turned and strode away .
<unk> clutched at Ledros .
He ’ d failed again , just as he had so many times before .
He saw himself in the early years after the Ruination , stalking the spirits of those who had killed her in life , convinced that destroying them would free her .
It hadn ’ t .
He ’ d spent countless years <unk> that goal , but it had <unk> to nothing .
He saw himself <unk> the <unk> <unk> captain , Hecarim , hacking his head from his shoulders and <unk> him back to the mist .
That one had struck Kalista the final , fatal blow , and had long <unk> , seeking his end .
Time and again they fought , as the years , and decades , and centuries rolled by , and the unseen stars turned overhead .
But Hecarim was strong of will , and he returned from the Black Mist , of course , each time more monstrous than the last .
Either way , it changed nothing .
Kalista became <unk> more lost as she absorbed the vengeful spirits of the mortals who pledged themselves to her , seeking her aid against their own betrayers .
Once , he had brought Kalista face to face with Hecarim , a <unk> that had taken dozens of lesser deaths to achieve .
He had believed that was the key to finally setting her free , and he ’ d rejoiced as he saw the now monstrous creature Hecarim skewered , a dozen spears piercing his towering frame … but banishing him to the darkness had done nothing .
A moment of satisfaction , and then it was past .
Nothing had changed .
Just another failure added to his growing <unk> .
At one point , despair drove him toward self destruction .
The purity of the one sunrise he ’ d seen since the blood had ceased coursing through his veins burned him , his <unk> body <unk> like <unk> .
<unk> at leaving Kalista behind clawed at him , but in that agony he had rejoiced , daring to believe he ’ d finally found release .
Even in seeking final oblivion , he had failed , and he ’ d been condemned to the madness of the Black Mist once more .
All the moments <unk> his <unk> blurred together in a never-ending cavalcade of horror and defeat .
He roared as a <unk> sorcerer cast him back to the darkness , tearing him asunder with <unk> <unk> savage joy he ’ d felt as he joined the slaughter in the streets of a <unk> harbor city overrun with the Black Mist gave way to sudden pain as he was blasted to nothingness by the faith of <unk> <unk> .
He laughed as a sword impaled him on its length , but his amusement turned to agony as the blade burst into searing light , burning with the <unk> of the sun .
Again and again and again he ’ d been condemned back to the nightmarish Black Mist , but always he ’ d returned .
Every time , he returned to a land locked in stasis , waking in the same place , the same way .
A being of lesser will would have succumbed to insanity long ago , as so many of the spirits had .
But not him .
<unk> clung to him , but his will was as iron .
His stubborn determination to free her kept him going .
That was what ensured he came back , over and over again .
<unk> back to the present , Ledros watched Kalista stalk away from him , intent on her unending mission .
A creeping <unk> settled within him .
Was it all for nothing ?
Was Thresh right ?
Was his attempt to free her from her path of retribution actually selfish ?
She was <unk> through this nightmare , unaware of its true horrors .
Would she thank him were he to wake her ?
Perhaps she would <unk> him , <unk> he had let her be .
Ledros shook his head , trying to <unk> the <unk> notion , even as a vision of Thresh — <unk> , predatory — appeared in his mind .
“ Get out of my head , ” he snarled , cursing Thresh .
A new idea came to him suddenly , banishing his lingering doubts and fears .
There was something he hadn ’ t tried , something he ’ d never considered until now .
“ Kalista , ” he called .
She did not heed him , and continued on her way , her step unrelenting .
He <unk> his sword belt , and cast his scabbarded blade to the ground .
He wouldn ’ t need it any more .
“ I betrayed you , ” he called out .
She stopped , her head whipping around , unblinking eyes locking on to him .
“ I should have stepped forward as soon as the order was given , ” Ledros continued .
“ I knew Hecarim was looking for any <unk> to be rid of you .
You ’ d always been the king ’ s favorite .
It all happened so fast , but I should have been faster .
We could have faced them , back to back .
We could have cut our way through them and been free , together !
I betrayed you with my inaction , Kalista .
I failed you . ” Kalista ’ s eyes narrowed “ <unk> , ” she intoned .
An ethereal spear <unk> in her grasp , and she began <unk> toward him .
Ledros <unk> his shield and threw it aside as she broke into a loping run .
He opened his arms wide , welcoming what was to come .
The first spear drove him back a step as it impaled him .
His had been the true betrayal .
He ’ d loved her , even if he ’ d only spoken those words aloud alone , in the darkness of night … A second spear drove through him , hurled with tremendous force .
He staggered , but <unk> remained standing .
He had not stepped in to stop her being murdered .
He was her real betrayer .
Her third spear plunged through him , and now he dropped to both knees .
He smiled , even as his strength <unk> from him .
Yes , this was it .
This was what would finally break her from that awful , unending spiral .
He was sure of it .
“ Finish it , ” he said , looking up at her .
“ Finish it , and be free . ” They stared at each other for a moment , a pair of undying spirits , their insubstantial forms rippling with deathless energy .
In that moment , Ledros felt only love .
In his mind ’ s eye , he saw her as she had been in life — <unk> , beautiful , strong .
“ Death to all betrayers , ” she said , and ran him through .
Ledros ’ vision <unk> as his form began to come apart , yet he saw Kalista ’ s expression change , the impassive mask <unk> , replaced with dawning horror .
“ Ledros ? ” she said , her voice now her own .
Her eyes were wide , and seemed to fill with shimmering tears .
She rushed to be beside him as Ledros fell .
“ What have I done ? ” she breathed .
He wanted to reassure her , but no words came forth .
I did this for you .
Darkness crashed in , and tendrils of mist reached to claim him .
Kalista reached out to comfort him , but her fingers passed through his <unk> form .
Her mouth moved , but he could not hear her over the roaring madness of the Black Mist .
His armor fell to the ground and turned to dust , along with his sword .
Blind terror beckoned , but he went into it gladly .
<unk> , he <unk> the pale specter of Thresh , watching from the shadows with his fixed , hungry smile .
Even the Chain Warden ’ s unwanted presence could not <unk> Ledros ’ moment of victory .
He ’ d done it .
He had freed her .
It was over .
Blind , <unk> terror .
<unk> , <unk> rage .
<unk> horror , cloying and choking .
And behind it all was the <unk> hunger — the yearning to feed on warmth and life , to draw more souls into darkness .
The cacophony was deafening — a <unk> screaming , tortured souls , writhing and roiling in shared torment .
This was the Black Mist .
And only the strongest of souls could escape its grasp .
Only those with unfinished business .
Blood pooled beneath him , bright crimson against pristine white stone .
His sword lay nearby , its blade broken .
His killers stood around him , shadows on the periphery , but he saw nothing except her .
Her eyes stared into his own , without seeing .
His blood-spattered face was reflected back at him .
He was lying on his side .
His breath was shallow , and weakening .
Her lifeless hand was cold , but he didn ’ t feel anything .
A calmness descended upon him like a shroud .
There was no pain , no fear , no doubt .
Not any more .
His armored fingers tightened around her hand .
He couldn ’ t be with her in life , but he would be with her in death .
For the first time in what seemed forever , he felt at peace … No .
Something was not right .
Reality crashed in .
None of this was real .
This was but an echo left behind , the <unk> pain of his death , hundreds of lifetimes <unk> .
<unk> , the Chain Warden was not here to <unk> him .
How long had it been , this time ?
There was no way to know .
<unk> , or a few minutes — it could have been either , and yet it hardly mattered .
Nothing changed in this vile realm of stasis .
Then he remembered , and hope surged through him .
It was not a sensation he was familiar with , but it <unk> like the first <unk> of a seemingly dead tree after <unk> .
He turned , and she was there , and for a moment he knew joy , true joy .
She was herself again , and she had come to him !
Then he saw her expression .
The cold , severe mask , the lack of recognition in her eyes .
The hope inside him withered and died .
Kalista stared past him , her head cocked , as if listening to something only she could hear .
“ We accept your pledge , ” she said , before turning and stepping into the mist .
Then she was gone .
Reaching out with his will , Ledros felt her now far away .
Someone had called to her , from a distant continent to the <unk> .
Someone else who had <unk> their soul for a promise of vengeance against whoever had <unk> them .
They knew not what horror awaited .
Bitterness and <unk> filled Ledros .
He cursed himself , twisting his hatred inward .
There was no hope .
He knew that now .
He ’ d been a fool to think otherwise .
She was trapped for eternity , as were they all .
Only pride and stubbornness had made him think he could solve it , like a riddle , for all these years .
<unk> and stubbornness — <unk> that were as much his bane in death as they had been in life , it seemed .
The cursed Chain Warden was right .
It was a selfish desire to free her , he saw that now .
Kalista may not be herself , but at least she was not tormented like he was .
At least she had purpose .
Ledros <unk> the pendant from around his neck , shattering the <unk> of its thin chain .
He hurled it into the mist .
To even hope for anything more was foolishness .
There could be no peace , not unless the curse that held these isles in its <unk> grasp was broken .
“ And so , I must end it , ” Ledros said .
<unk> called .
Thresh stepped from the darkness .
He glanced around , <unk> he was alone .
Then he knelt and picked up the <unk> silver pendant .
The fool had been so close .
He was on the <unk> of bringing her back … and now , after countless centuries of trying , he had abandoned his task , at the very moment of success .
Thresh smiled , cruelly .
He liked seeing hope <unk> and die , like blighted fruit upon the <unk> , as what could have been sweet turned to poison .
It amused him .
He opened his lantern , and tossed the pendant within .
Then he stepped back into the darkness , and faded from view .
After a time , the rattle of his chains faded , and he was gone .
= = = = = = DO NO <unk> = = = = = = = = UNKNOWN = = It has been while , Mundo thought , <unk> the massive purple tongue that hung from his mouth like an <unk> <unk> swinging from <unk> , since Mundo made a <unk> .
He rolled out of his bed ( a large wooden box filled with sharpened knives and rusty nails ) , brushed his teeth ( with a nail <unk> ) , and ate <unk> ( a <unk> ) .
Mundo felt <unk> .
He felt alive .
Today was a fine day for <unk> medicine .
He spotted his first patient <unk> shimmerdrops just outside <unk> ’ s <unk> <unk> .
The man limped around in a circle , shouting at everyone within arm ’ s length about how shimmerdrops would make their eyes roll into the backs of their heads and how if they didn ’ t buy some right now , right this second , then they were damn <unk> and did you just give him a condescending look ?
Because he ’ ll kill you and your family and your family ’ s family .
Mundo took out his notepad , a <unk> he often used to mark down <unk> about his <unk> , both past and present .
The notepad was large , yellow , and <unk> .
Patient <unk> signs of <unk> , Mundo would have written if he hadn ’ t been <unk> <unk> <unk> in the air with a meaty finger .
<unk> infection of nervous <unk> <unk> <unk> virus , he might have <unk> if he were <unk> of such <unk> thought .
“ MUNDO <unk> <unk> AND <unk> <unk> GOOD , ” he said to himself .
Rank was just about to pack up his shimmerdrops and head home for the night .
He needed to get new <unk> .
These ones rubbed his feet raw when he walked , and at the end of a long day ’ s work , hadn ’ t he earned the soft leather of <unk> ?
As Rank was thinking this , a huge purple monster jumped out of the shadows and yelled , “ MUNDO <unk> <unk> OF <unk> <unk> WORK . ” Mundo left his first patient more or less as he found him ( save for a few limbs ) and took to the <unk> <unk> , a market <unk> <unk> in <unk> toys .
Though most of the <unk> were closed , Mundo <unk> a lone Zaunite <unk> to and <unk> as he stumbled down the path .
The Zaunite sang a song of a <unk> beauty and the <unk> boy from the <unk> who loved her , except he seemed to have forgotten most of the words apart from “ big ol ’ eyes ” and “ gave it to her . ” An empty bottle <unk> from his hand , and he looked as if he hadn ’ t had a <unk> in months .
Was this man <unk> by the same disease that had ravaged the <unk> <unk> ?
Was this a virus ?
An epidemic in the making ?
Mundo had to act fast .
This was clearly a man in need of medical attention .
“ <unk> <unk> OF <unk> AND <unk> <unk> MUNDO IN <unk> , ” the purple monstrosity said as he tossed a bonesaw into the drunk ’ s back .
Mundo descended into Zaun ’ s Sump level .
If there was a virus going around , chances were it <unk> here .
There must be a patient zero somewhere .
If he could just cure the first <unk> of this mystery disease , Mundo knew he could cure the rest of Zaun .
But how was Mundo to find one <unk> patient in the <unk> of the Sump level ?
What steps would he take to <unk> , <unk> , and fix this most suffering of <unk> ?
How would he – - Mundo heard something .
<unk> , and a rhythmic <unk> of metal against metal .
He followed the noise as carefully and quietly as he could – - wouldn ’ t want to <unk> the patient into running away and infecting even more people – - and found exactly what he was looking for .
A young boy .
No older than fifteen , probably , with a shock of white hair and a large metal <unk> in his hand .
He had some sort of <unk> tattooed onto his face .
Maybe a warning ?
A symbol that he was not to be approached under any <unk> ?
Mundo knew he ’ d found him .
Patient zero .
It would be a <unk> operation , <unk> skill , <unk> , a careful eye and – - “ YOU <unk> <unk> A <unk> <unk> , ” the creature said , leaping out .
His enormous purple form <unk> through the air , massive bonesaw in hand , tongue flapping in the wind .
The boy was <unk> , but not <unk> .
<unk> hanging out in the Sump knew to be ready for trouble at a moment ’ s notice , and the <unk> had <unk> of time to prepare .
Nothing but time , in <unk> .
No two ways about it : this was a <unk> patient .
He refused to answer Mundo ’ s questions about his medical history , and continued to evade Mundo ’ s attempts to make him take his medicine .
He repeated himself over and over again ( perhaps suffering from a case of physical <unk> ? )
and had no respect for <unk> Mundo ’ s <unk> .
The two <unk> over the child ’ s sickness for what felt like hours .
Mundo made what he thought were very <unk> points about the <unk> of treatment , but the child constantly <unk> Mundo ’ s attempts to help him .
Mundo grew tired of <unk> with the boy .
He mustered up one final attempt at treatment , wielding his <unk> <unk> with the artistry of a Demacian <unk> .
The words of his medical vows - – “ MUNDO <unk> ALL <unk> , MUNDO DO <unk> <unk> <unk> ” – - ran through his head again and again .
His desire to cure this child filled him with purpose and determination .
He swung with all his might .
The treatment was a success .
But then – - somehow – - the treatment reversed itself .
Whatever good Mundo had <unk> in his last attempt at a cure was suddenly undone .
To Mundo ’ s utter confusion , the child <unk> away , utterly <unk> .
Mundo screamed in irritation .
“ <unk> <unk> ’ <unk> MUNDO <unk> <unk> ALL ? ” he screamed to the sky .
Not every operation was a success .
Mundo would be the first to admit that .
Still , Mundo tried to focus on the <unk> : <unk> from this most <unk> patient , Mundo had helped an awful lot of people .
He ’ d done a full day ’ s work , and now it was time to rest .
As the sun came up , Mundo <unk> home and tucked himself into bed .
Who knew what tomorrow might bring ?
Another patient to help .
Another epidemic to stop .
A <unk> ’ s work was never done .
= = = = = = STRAND BY <unk> STRAND = = = = = = = = UNKNOWN = = The weeks spent on the ocean had made Markus feel dizzy and weak , so he was glad to be back on dry land .
The path leading from the <unk> shore had a slick , oily quality , making it treacherous underfoot .
The crooked trees to either side were wretched , blackened <unk> that wept yellowed <unk> from where it looked like some panicked animal had clawed them ragged .
<unk> light shimmered between the trees , dancing like the corpse candles that flickered over marshland and drew <unk> souls to their doom .
The branches were hung with what looked like <unk> of ragged <unk> , and it took Markus a moment to realize they were <unk> of cobwebs .
<unk> <unk> clogged the undergrowth on either side of the path , rustling with the motion of unseen creatures <unk> their passage through the forest .
Perhaps the rats <unk> the ship had followed them .
Markus had never caught sight of one , beyond a fleeting glimpse of a swollen , <unk> body or the <unk> sound of claws on wood .
He ’ d never been able to shake the notion that it sounded as if these rats had a few too many legs than any normal rat should have .
The island ’ s air was heavy with damp , and his finely tailored <unk> and boots were <unk> with clinging <unk> .
He held a <unk> <unk> beneath his nose , but it did little to <unk> the stench of the island , <unk> him of the charnel pits beyond the walls of Noxus when the winds blew in from the ocean .
<unk> back to his homeland , he felt a brief <unk> of unease .
The <unk> in the catacombs far beneath the city had been a <unk> <unk> thrill , a <unk> for following the secret symbol of the <unk> bloom .
<unk> the darkened <unk> , he and his fellows gathered as <unk> .
Where she awaited .
He looked ahead , hoping for a glimpse of the beguiling woman whose words had brought so many of them to this place .
He caught a flash of crimson silk and swaying hips before the mist <unk> between the trees obscured his sight of her .
He ’ d thrilled to the <unk> of her ancient god , and had been <unk> when he and the others had been <unk> to join her on this <unk> .
It seemed like a grand <unk> when they boarded the heavily laden <unk> at midnight , under the still gaze of the mute and hooded steersman , but being so far from Noxus had begun to dull his <unk> .
Markus paused and turned to look back along the path .
His fellow <unk> pushed past , like <unk> <unk> <unk> route to the <unk> ’ s hammer .
What was wrong with them ?
Behind them came the steersman , gliding over the path as though his feet barely touched it .
His robes were undulant with motion and suffocating fear <unk> in Markus ’ s <unk> at the thought of being near this <unk> figure .
He turned away , only to find himself face to face with her .
“ Elise … ” he said , and the breath caught in his throat .
He <unk> wanted to push her away and flee this awful place , but the <unk> of her dark beauty <unk> any thought of <unk> .
His sense of <unk> passed so swiftly he wasn ’ t even sure he ’ d truly felt it .
“ Markus , ” she said , and the sound of his name on her lips was <unk> , sending a <unk> of <unk> down his spine .
Her beauty transfixed him , and he savored every detail of her perfect form .
Her features were angular and sharp , framed by <unk> crimson hair , like that of a <unk> girl he once knew .
Full lips and eyes of dark radiance drew him deeper into her web with the promise of <unk> yet to come .
A cloak of <unk> <unk> by an eight-pronged brooch , <unk> her <unk> shoulders .
It rippled with motion , though there was no wind to stir it .
“ Is something the matter , Markus ? ” she said .
Her smoky tones soothed his fear like a <unk> .
“ I need you to be at peace .
You are at peace , aren ’ t you , Markus ? ” “ Yes , Elise , ” he said .
“ I am at peace . ” “ Good .
It would make me unhappy to know you were not at peace when we are so close . ” The thought of <unk> her sent a jolt of panic through Markus and he dropped to the ground .
He wrapped his arms around her legs , her limbs slender and <unk> white , smooth and cold to the touch .
“ Anything for you , mistress , ” he said .
She looked down on him and smiled .
For an instant Markus thought he saw something long , thin and <unk> shift beneath her cloak .
The motion was <unk> and unnatural , but he didn ’ t care .
She hooked a sharpened , <unk> <unk> under his chin and drew him to his feet .
A <unk> of blood ran down his neck , but he ignored it as she turned and led him onward .
He willingly followed , all thoughts save pleasing her vanishing like <unk> smoke .
The trees thinned out and the path ended before a rocky cliff carved with <unk> symbols that made his eyes sting .
A shadowed cave gaped like a vile maw at the base of the cliff , and Markus felt his certainty <unk> as a sudden sense of dread uncoiled in his gut .
Elise beckoned him inside , and he was powerless to resist .
The interior of the cave was <unk> dark and <unk> warm , a clammy , <unk> heat that <unk> like offal swept from a <unk> ’ s <unk> .
A voice deep inside was screaming at him to run , to get as far from this hideous place as possible , but his <unk> feet carried him still deeper into the cave .
A <unk> from somewhere high above landed on his cheek and he flinched at the sudden , burning pain of it .
He looked up at the cavern roof , seeing pale , <unk> shapes hanging overhead and swaying with frantic , trapped motion .
In the translucent surface of the <unk> web , a human face screamed in mute horror against the suffocating , <unk> <unk> .
“ What is this place ? ” he asked , the <unk> of <unk> woven around him falling away .
“ This is my temple , Markus , ” said Elise , reaching up to <unk> the eight-pronged brooch at her shoulder and letting her cloak fall away .
“ This is the lair of the <unk> <unk> . ” Her shoulders <unk> as two pairs of slender , <unk> limbs unfolded from the flesh of her back ; long , dark and <unk> to razored talons .
They lifted Elise up as a grotesque , bloated mass shifted in the darkness behind her .
<unk> legs heaved its <unk> body forward , the faint light from beyond the cave reflecting on the myriad <unk> of its eyes .
The vast spider ’ s bulk was enormous , <unk> and <unk> with wet , mutant <unk> .
The terror of its nightmarish <unk> shattered the last of Elise ’ s hold on Markus , and he fled toward the cave mouth with her cruel laughter ringing in his ears .
<unk> of sticky web struck the rock beside him .
<unk> strands struck his flailing limbs and his pace slowed as he became more and more <unk> .
He heard the clicking of clawed limbs in pursuit and wept at the thought of her touching him .
Yet more strands of her web <unk> him as something sharp stabbed his shoulder with <unk> <unk> .
Markus fell to his knees , <unk> venom spreading through his body and locking him in a prison of his own flesh .
A shadow fell across him and he saw the mute steersman with his arms outstretched .
Markus screamed as the steersman ’ s hooded robe collapsed , revealing that this was not a man at all , but a writhing nest of <unk> spiders given the <unk> of a man .
They fell upon him in their thousands , and his screams were choked to muffled <unk> as they crawled into his mouth , clogged his ears and burrowed behind his eyes .
Elise swung into view above him , borne aloft by the jointed limbs at her back .
She was no longer beautiful , no longer even human .
Her features were alight with a ferocious hunger that could never be <unk> .
The looming form of her monstrous spider god lifted Markus from the ground with its razored <unk> .
“ You have to die now , Markus , ” said Elise .
“ Why … ? ” he managed with his last breath .
Elise smiled , her mouth now filled with needle-like fangs .
“ So that I can live . ” = = = = = = THE <unk> <unk> = = = = = = = = UNKNOWN = = Evelynn <unk> through the teeming streets , the shadows of her body <unk> <unk> with the night .
Her eyes glinted within the gloom , though only the keenest observer would have noticed .
<unk> , sailors , and <unk> <unk> in a nearby <unk> , <unk> unaware they were being watched by a demon in the dark .
The demon , on the other hand , saw them all with perfect clarity , and <unk> them with the most <unk> eye .
Evelynn ’ s gaze settled on a man lying in the gutter , a bottle of <unk> wine dangling from his hands .
Ordinarily , the demon wouldn ’ t give a second thought to someone in his condition .
But she had not <unk> in days , and she found herself desperate enough to consider the man , if only for a moment .
It would be so easy .
All she needed was to <unk> him to one of the numerous alleys far from the glow of the street lamps .
The thought perished as she watched a <unk> <unk> across the drunk ’ s face .
This was a man too inebriated to feel .
His <unk> would be vague and muted , with none of the urgent <unk> she loved to see in her victims before she brought them low .
She might even <unk> an entire arm before he mustered a scream .
And that was the problem .
Over the course of countless <unk> , Evelynn had learned everything about her <unk> : She preferred — no , needed — her victims to feel every <unk> , every bite , every bit of flesh she peeled away with her claws .
A man in this condition would be dull and <unk> , scarcely worth her time .
She <unk> the drunk and continued down the <unk> <unk> , past the windows of a dank , <unk> tavern .
A fat , <unk> woman threw open its door and stumbled out into the night , grasping a <unk> <unk> leg .
For a moment , Evelynn considered the woman , how she might <unk> her into an embrace , and then into the <unk> hell that would follow .
The demon watched as the woman <unk> down the rest of the meat , never tasting it .
There was something deep inside her , a <unk> that would <unk> the experience .
Evelynn preferred <unk> the pain herself .
The demon moved on , gliding through the shadows of the town , over two more <unk> , past a <unk> asking for <unk> , between a <unk> in the midst of an argument .
Evelynn found them all completely <unk> .
<unk> them would be like plucking a flower that had already wilted .
She preferred her <unk> tall and healthy , for those were the most satisfying to cut down .
A <unk> thought overtook her .
Perhaps she ’ d made a mistake choosing this wretched <unk> as her hunting ground .
Perhaps , at any moment , the thrill from her last victim might wear off , leaving only the nothingness — that utterly empty space inside her where feelings should be .
And then , she saw him … The gentleman was <unk> beaming as he exited one of the <unk> <unk> .
He was <unk> without being <unk> , and he <unk> a <unk> tune to himself as he set off down the street with a bouquet of flowers tucked gingerly in the <unk> of his arm .
The two lashers on Evelynn ’ s back writhed with excitement .
Even from a distance , she sensed this man was completely content in his own skin .
She dashed after the gentleman , taking great care not to lose track of her prey or to <unk> him to her presence .
He walked for nearly half an hour before finally turning up a long <unk> toward a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
At the end of the path , the man stepped through the heavy oak door to his home .
Evelynn held her unblinking gaze on the windows of the man ’ s house as they lit one by one with warm candlelight .
A slender , <unk> woman in a <unk> evening gown entered and greeted the man with a welcoming embrace .
She <unk> a slight surprise at the flowers he had brought , before placing them in a clean <unk> , right next to an old bouquet .
The demon ’ s interest grew .
A moment later , two children , scarcely out of <unk> , ran into the room and threw their arms around the man ’ s legs , their wide grins <unk> with tiny teeth .
Though the scene played like the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , Evelynn knew what she would find if she <unk> just a little deeper .
She waited <unk> , watching the candles go out one by one , until only the <unk> remained lit .
The man was alone , settling into a reading chair to draw on his pipe .
Evelynn crept out of the shadows , her dark , <unk> limbs giving way to warm flesh .
Her <unk> lashers disappeared behind her back , revealing a <unk> <unk> form , with curves too <unk> for any eye to ignore .
Her hips <unk> softly as she <unk> across the lawn to the window .
She was nearly arm ’ s length from the glass when she saw the man bolt upright from his chair at the sight of her , his pipe nearly falling from his mouth .
Evelynn beckoned with a single finger , motioning for the man to join her outside .
The man crept to the front door and opened it <unk> , curious to investigate the strange beauty lurking outside his window .
He approached her on the lawn with great <unk> , and greater anticipation .
“ Who … are you ? ” he asked <unk> .
“ I ’ m whatever you want me to be , ” <unk> the demon .
As Evelynn locked eyes with the man , she <unk> the depths of his soul and found exactly what she was looking for — that tiny <unk> of <unk> that <unk> within even the <unk> person .
There it is , she thought .
All that he wants and cannot have .
“ My family … ” the man said , unable to finish his thought .
The demon leaned close .
“ <unk> .
It ’ s okay , ” she whispered in the man ’ s ear .
“ I know what you want , and the guilt you feel for <unk> it .
Let it go . ” She pulled back to find the man <unk> <unk> .
“ Can I … have you ? ” he asked , ashamed of his <unk> , but overcome by a strange desire to take her right there on the lawn .
“ Of course , <unk> .
That ’ s why I ’ m here , ” said the demon .
He touched her face with the tips of his fingers , caressing her cheek .
She held his hand firmly to her skin and released a soft , <unk> chuckle .
This sweet , tender , happy man would be hers tonight .
He had so much pain to give , and she would take it all .
From behind them , the <unk> of <unk> feet sounded from the open doorway of the house .
“ Is everything okay , love ? ” asked the man ’ s wife .
“ Everything ’ s going to be <unk> , my <unk> , ” the demon answered for the <unk> man .
The deal had become even <unk> , and the <unk> more <unk> .
There was one <unk> in full flower to pluck , and one <unk> to bloom while it watched .

Oh , no , I ’ ll not be <unk> ’ the dice with ye .

There were a time , though ... What happened ?
The River King happened , that ’ s what .
Aye , Two-Coats , that old devil Tahm Kench .
He ’ s what happened .
I was <unk> , beg your pardon , and <unk> ’ in a <unk> .
Had nothin ’ to me name , not ‘ <unk> a single gold <unk> , this one ‘ <unk> into my possession .
I could tell you how , but you ’ d call me a liar , <unk> .
So , with this one coin , what I <unk> done was pay me <unk> , and find a new crew to join .
I was a <unk> , see .
<unk> put aside whatever was left for the future .
Been responsible , like .
<unk> ’ s a harsh life , even for a younger man .
But that ’ s when the River King found me .
“ Why work someone else ’ s ship , ” he says , “ <unk> ’ away , <unk> ’ your life for next t ’ nothin ’ , when ye might ‘ ave a ship o ’ your own ? ” I just had to think bigger , like .
<unk> ’ course , one Kraken won ’ t buy a ship , but ‘ e had an answer to that , didn ’ t he .
<unk> .
One good throw o ’ the bones , an ’ I ’ d ‘ ave enough to start me own little operation .
Others could do the danger work , while I sits back , nice and <unk> , <unk> ’ the <unk> .
An ’ after a few more <unk> , you understand , that crooked devil ’ s advice <unk> to make a lot o ’ sense to my ears .
So , <unk> by greed and possibility , I went along wi ’ it .
That night were a blur .
I awoke well after <unk> the next day , me head <unk> <unk> ’ !
Had no idea where I <unk> <unk> <unk> , as it turns <unk> on the dresser were me previous night ’ s <unk> ... more than enough to purchase me self a ship !
Ah , but the River King , ‘ e ’ d given me a taste for <unk> ’ more .
Why should young Lars content his self with a single ship , when he could ‘ ave a <unk> ?
Just needed to chance me hand a few more times ... That ’ s Bilgewater .
There ’ s <unk> to be had , if you ’ re <unk> ’ to risk everything , over and over .
With old <unk> ’ s arm around me , I was led from the dice tables to other <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> games to gamblin ’ and <unk> ’ <unk> , high and low .
I spent a fortune , lost a fortune , then made it all back again .
Around and around in that <unk> ’ spiral I went .
I was <unk> ’ the hunger , the yearning , and it was <unk> ’ me down like a <unk> .
Years passed , an ’ somewhere along the way , I ’ m ashamed to say I forgot what I was doing all this for .
I forgot who I was .
I had it all , but it never were enough .
I wanted more .
And then I started <unk> ’ big .
That made me <unk> , go for broke , <unk> ’ , looking for the big stakes to put me back on top .
Pretty soon , I was in a worse state than I ’ d been to start with .
<unk> ’ in the gutter , catching rats to eat if I were lucky .
I begged , borrowed and <unk> from everyone who ’ d ever shown me any kindness .
Lost all me mates , chasing the dream .
‘ <unk> feeds on misery , see , does Tahm Kench .
As old as sin , ‘ e is , and older than Bilgewater by far .
Been ‘ round from the start of things , <unk> ’ his self on the desperation what comes with the greed and sorrow in men ’ s hearts .
I mean , I ’ d done it to me self , but it were him what give me the means .
Ye might say , ‘ e took me to the cliff ’ s edge , but I were the <unk> what threw me self off , beg your pardon , and that old <unk> revelled in me despair .

In the darkest night , <unk> ’ an ’ <unk> ’ , ‘ e pressed this gold Kraken back into me hand , with a <unk> ’ <unk> .

It were this damn coin what started me on that wretched path !

Never too late .

‘ Course I was !
But no .

And , sure enough , the temptation ’ s still there , now , every day .
So here I am .

All the best years of me life behind me , wasted in those lost decades .
Can ’ t remember most of it , neither , so I ’ ve no idea if I even enjoyed me self .

There ’ s a lesson to be learned , ‘ <unk> your purse strings tight , and never , ever make a deal wi ’ the River King .

“ Master .
I can ’ t do it . ” <unk> gave him a chance to catch his breath .
Who knew failure could be so <unk> ?
In that moment , he looked for <unk> in the older man ’ s eyes — to his disgust , he saw it right there , as bare as the <unk> sky .
When Kegan ’ s master spoke , it was with the lilting flow of faraway lands .
His was an accent rarely carried by these northern winds .
“ It is not a matter of whether you can , ” he said .
“ Only that you must . ” The older man <unk> his fingers .
With a purple flash , the <unk> of deadwood flared to life ; a campfire born in a single moment of <unk> .
Kegan turned from the fire and spat into the snow .
They were words he ’ d heard before , and they were as useless now as they always were .
“ You make it seem so easy . ” His master shrugged , as if even that <unk> accusation needed a moment ’ s thought before <unk> .
“ It is simple , perhaps .
Not easy .
The two aren ’ t always the same thing . ” “ But there has to be another way … ” Kegan muttered , <unk> touching his fingertips to the <unk> <unk> his cheek .
Even as he said it , he found himself believing it .
It had to be true .
It wouldn ’ t always be like this .
It couldn ’ t always be like this .
“ Why ? ” His master looked at him with <unk> curiosity in the light of his eyes .
“ Why must there be another way ?
Because you continue to <unk> at this one ? ” Kegan grunted .
“ <unk> questions with questions is a coward ’ s way of speaking . ” His master raised one dark eyebrow .
“ And there it is .
The wisdom of a barbarian who cannot yet read , or count past the number of fingers on his hands . ” The tension faded as the two of them shared a grim smile .
They warmed broth , <unk> it from ivory <unk> as their campfire cast them in a flickering amber glow .
Above them — above the tundra for hundreds of <unk> around — the sky rippled with light .
Kegan watched the heavens ’ familiar performance , the <unk> radiance caressing the moon and the stars that <unk> it .
For all that he <unk> this land , there was beauty here in abundance , if a man knew where to look .
Sometimes that was as simple as looking up .
“ The spirits dance wildly tonight , ” he said .
His master tilted his unnatural gaze skyward .
“ The aurora ?
That is not the work of spirits — only the action of <unk> winds on the upper reaches of … ” Kegan stared at him .
His master trailed off , and awkwardly cleared his throat .
“ Never mind . ” Silence returned to <unk> them .
Kegan drew the knife from his belt , setting to work on a sliver of <unk> wood .
He carved with easy <unk> .
Hands that had set fires and ended lives now turned to a far more peaceful purpose .
Out of the corner of his eye , he saw that the sorcerer was watching him .
“ I want you to breathe in , ” the older man said .
The blade still scraped over the bark .
“ I ’ m breathing now .
I ’ m always breathing . ” “ Please , ” his master said , with an edge of impatience , “ do not be so <unk> . ” “ So what ? ” “ <unk> .
It means … Well , never mind what it means .
I want you to breathe in , and hold it as long as you can . ” “ Why ? ” His master exhaled something like a sigh .
“ Fine , ” Kegan agreed , <unk> the <unk> into the fire and <unk> his bone-handled knife once more .
“ Fine , fine , fine . ” He took a deep breath , swelling the muscles of his chest and shoulders .
<unk> as he held his breath , he looked to his master for whatever would come next .
“ You do not create the air you breathe , ” the sorcerer said .
“ You draw it inside you , letting it <unk> you .
You use it as your body <unk> , and then release it as you <unk> .
It is never yours .
You are just a vessel for it .
You breathe in , you breathe out .
You are a channel through which air flows . ” Kegan made to release his breath , though his master shook his head .
“ No .
Not yet .
Feel the air in your lungs , Kegan .
Feel it pushing at the cage of your body .
Feel it straining to escape . ” The young barbarian ’ s features were <unk> red .
His eyes asked the question his mouth could not .
“ No , ” the sorcerer answered .
He gestured to Kegan with a <unk> hand .
“ Keep holding . ” When Kegan ’ s endurance finally gave out , defiance took over , <unk> him more time .
When even his defiance began to ebb with the pain of his quivering chest , naked stubbornness took control .
He glared daggers at his master , trembling with the effort , knowing this was surely a <unk> — knowing he had to prove something , without knowing just what it might be .
<unk> <unk> the edge of his vision .
His pulse was rhythmic thunder in his ears .
All the while his master looked on , saying nothing .
Finally , his breath burst back into the chill evening air , and Kegan <unk> , gasping , as he recovered .
He was a wolf in that moment , a wild animal baring his teeth at the world around him , offering a threat to any that might attack in his moment of weakness .
His master watched this , too .
“ I was beginning to wonder if you would actually let yourself pass out , ” he murmured .
Kegan grinned , and pounded a fist against his chest , <unk> proud of how long he ’ d held out .
“ <unk> lies the problem , ” his master observed , reading his posture .
“ I told you the air was not yours , yet you are thrilled with yourself for how long you kept it inside you .
It is the same with magic .
You want it , believing it can be owned .
You cling to it , <unk> that you are merely a channel through which it <unk> .
You <unk> it in your heart , and in your hands .
And so the magic is <unk> in your grip , because you see it as something to bind to your will .
It is not , and never will be .
It is like air .
You must draw in what exists around you , use it for a moment , then let it free . ” The two of them — student and master , barbarian and sorcerer — fell silent again .
The wind howled through the <unk> to the south , bringing a keening cry on the breeze .
Kegan <unk> the older man suspiciously .
“ So … why didn ’ t you just say all that ?
Why make me hold my breath ? ” “ I have said all of that before .
Several dozen times , in several dozen ways .
I hoped a <unk> <unk> to the lesson might aid your <unk> . ” Kegan snorted , then glared into the fire .
“ Master .
Something ’ s been <unk> on my mind of late . ” The sorcerer chuckled to himself and patted the rolled , bound <unk> leashed to his back .
“ No , Kegan .
I am not letting you read this . ” The young <unk> grinned , though his stare was devoid of mirth .
“ That ’ s not what I wanted to ask , ” he said .
“ What if I ’ m not a bad student ?
What if you ’ re just a bad teacher ? ” His master stared into the flames , his weary eyes reflecting the dancing firelight .
“ Sometimes I wonder that myself , ” he replied .
The next day , they <unk> north , and west .
It would not be long before even the <unk> tundra froze over , leaving them <unk> through fields of lifeless ice .
For now , their boots crunched on useless , rocky soil , broken only by <unk> <unk> .
The sorcerer ’ s thoughts were as bleak as their surroundings , but Kegan was his usual self — <unk> without <unk> , but <unk> without joy .
“ You said something the other day , ” the barbarian said as he drew alongside his master .
“ Something that sounded like a lie . ” The sorcerer turned slightly , his features shadowed by his hood .
“ I am many things , ” said the older man , “ and not all of them are <unk> .
But I am not a liar . ” Kegan grunted what may or may not have been an <unk> .
“ Perhaps not a lie , then .
More like … a <unk> . ” The sorcerer was watching him as they walked .
“ Go on . ” “ That place .
That empire .
The kingdom you said was destroyed lifetimes ago . ” “ Shurima ?
What of it ? ” “ You said it lay in a land never touched by frost , or <unk> by ice . ” Kegan grinned as if sharing a <unk> .
“ I ’ m not as <unk> as you believe I am , master . ” The sorcerer found himself dragged out of his <unk> by the barbarian ’ s curiosity .
He <unk> the burden of his <unk> to his other shoulder , unable to hide a small smile .
“ That was no lie . ” He stopped walking , turning to point southward .
“ Far , far to the south , many hundreds of days ’ walk , and across another ocean , there lies a land where … ” How does one explain the desert to a man that knows only winter ?
he thought .
How does one explain sand to a man that knows nothing but ice ?
“ … a land where the earth is hot dust , and where snow is utterly unknown .
The sun beats down without mercy .
Even rain is rare .
The ground <unk> for it , day after day . ” Kegan was staring at him again .
He had that look in his pale eyes , the one that said he didn ’ t dare trust what was being told , in case it was some trick to make him look foolish .
The sorcerer had seen that look in the eyes of many , in his time — lonely children and fragile <unk> <unk> .
“ A place that has never felt <unk> ’ s touch , ” Kegan murmured .
“ But is the world really that large , that a man can walk for so long and still not see its end ? ” “ It is the truth .
There are whole lands elsewhere in the world that are not frozen .
In time , you will learn that there are few places as cold as the Freljord . ” The conversation was <unk> for the rest of the day ’ s journey , and when they made camp , there seemed little more to say .
Even so , the young barbarian <unk> .
He looked across the campfire , to where his master sat cross-legged in sullen introspection .
“ <unk> ’ t you be <unk> me something ? ” The sorcerer raised an eyebrow .
“ Should I ? ” He always had a look about him that suggested his apprentice was <unk> him just by being alive .
They ’ d been together for a few weeks now .
Kegan was growing used to it .
The youth dragged his hands through <unk> hair , brushing his mother ’ s ivory trinkets from his face .
He muttered something that would , with imagination , pass for an agreement .
When the sorcerer still refused to answer , he pressed harder .
“ So , will we get to ... wherever it is we ’ re going , today ? ” His master regarded him carefully .
“ No .
We will not reach our destination for several weeks . ” The sorcerer did not seem to be <unk> .
“ And I have given more thought to the <unk> you suffer in <unk> your gifts , ” he added , <unk> .
Kegan wasn ’ t sure what to say .
Sometimes silence was the only way to avoid looking ignorant or impatient , so he tried that .
It seemed to work , for the sorcerer continued .
“ You have some talent , true enough .
The <unk> is in your blood .
Now you must stop <unk> magic as an <unk> , <unk> force .
It need not be <unk> , merely … <unk> .
I have watched you .
When you reach out to wield it , you seek to <unk> it to your will .
You want control . ” Kegan was getting <unk> now .
“ But that ’ s how magic works .
That ’ s what my mother always did .
She wanted it to do something , so she made it happen . ” The sorcerer suppressed a <unk> of irritation .
“ You don ’ t need to make magic happen .
Magic exists in the world .
The raw stuff of creation is all around us .
You do not need to <unk> it , and bend it to your needs .
You can just … <unk> it .
<unk> it along the path you would prefer it to take . ” As he spoke , he moved his hands as if shaping a ball of clay .
A faint chime sounded in the empty air , holding to its eternal , perfect note .
<unk> energies snaked between his fingers , binding to one another in slow <unk> .
Several of them <unk> out from the sphere to <unk> around his <unk> hands , <unk> and darkly <unk> .
“ There will always be those that <unk> magic with rigid intent , <unk> the ways one can <unk> their will on the primal forces .
And , <unk> as it is , it will work .
Slowly , and with limited results .
But you don ’ t need to <unk> so <unk> , Kegan .
I am not shaping these energies into a sphere .
I ’ m merely <unk> them to form one .
Do you understand ? ” “ I see , ” Kegan admitted , “ but that ’ s not the same as understanding . ” The sorcerer nodded , sharing a small smile .
<unk> his apprentice had finally uttered something <unk> .
“ Some men and women , souls of iron discipline or limited imagination , will <unk> the magical energy that flows between realms .
They will manipulate it , and bind it , however they are able .
They are looking at sunlight through a crack in the wall , <unk> at how it <unk> into their dark chambers .
Instead , they could just go outside , and <unk> in the blinding light of day . ” He sighed <unk> .
“ Your mother was one such mage , Kegan .
Through <unk> ritual and traditional concoctions , she <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
But all she was doing — all any of them can do with their rituals and talismans and spell books — is create a <unk> between themselves and the <unk> forces at play . ” Kegan watched the sphere <unk> and <unk> , not bound within the sorcerer ’ s touch at all ; constantly overlapping it , or threatening to roll free .
“ Here is the secret , young barbarian . ” Their eyes met in that moment ; pale and human , reflected against shimmering and … whatever his master really was .
“ I ’ m listening , ” Kegan said , <unk> than he intended .
He ’ d not wanted to appear ignorant and awed , especially since he knew he was both .
“ Magic wants to be used , ” said the sorcerer .
“ It is all around us , <unk> from the first fragments of creation .
It wants to be wielded .
And that is the true challenge on the path we both walk .
When you realize what the magic wants , how eager it is … Well , then the <unk> isn ’ t how to begin wielding it .
It ’ s knowing when to stop . ” The sorcerer opened his hands , gently <unk> the sphere of <unk> forces towards his apprentice .
The barbarian <unk> reached out to welcome it , only for it to burst the moment his fingers <unk> its surface .
The trails of mist thinned and faded away .
The ringing chime grew <unk> , then <unk> silent .
“ You will learn , ” the sorcerer promised .
“ Patience and <unk> are the <unk> <unk> , but they are all you will ever need . ” Kegan nodded , though not at once , and not without a sliver of doubt .
The sorcerer didn ’ t sleep that night .
He lay awake , wrapped in a crude blanket of furs , staring up at the aurora undulating across the night sky .
On the other side of the banked fire , the barbarian <unk> .
<unk> <unk> the dreams of the unburdened , thought the sorcerer .
No .
That was <unk> .
Kegan was a <unk> , yes , but he was a youth <unk> <unk> from a land of endless <unk> .
The Freljord <unk> souls whose instinct was forever focused on survival above all else .
<unk> with iron hides and <unk> fangs stalked the wilds .
<unk> from rival villages shed blood all along the icy coasts .
Their winter had <unk> a hundred lifetimes .
These people grew in a land where writing and artistry were <unk> ; where the reading of books was an <unk> <unk> , and <unk> was told and <unk> down the <unk> in whispered stories by weary elders and <unk> shamans .
And Kegan , for all his <unk> stubbornness , was far from unburdened .
Is it a mistake , bringing him with me ?
Was this a moment of mercy , or a moment of weakness ?
There seemed no answer to that .
I could have left him .
As soon as the thought <unk> , the rest of it rose <unk> , <unk> swift .
And he would not be the first I had abandoned ...
The sorcerer looked through the haze of heat that shimmered above the faded fire , and watched the barbarian sleep .
The young man ’ s lip twitched , with an answering flicker of his fingers .
“ I should wonder what you dream of , Kegan Rodhe , ” the sorcerer whispered .
“ What ghosts of fading memory reach out to <unk> you ?
” Night after night , in his dreams , Kegan walked the paths of his past .
Before meeting the sorcerer , he had been an <unk> , wandering the frozen <unk> alone , warmed only by his <unk> <unk> to die .
And before that ?
A brawler .
A failed shaman .
A son to a distant mother .
He was still young by any <unk> beyond that of the Freljord , with scarcely the chill of nineteen <unk> in his bones .
He had lived hard , by his wits and the edge of his blade , winning a cut of <unk> and more than his fair share of <unk> .
Night after night , in his dreams , he was a ragged <unk> lost in the howling white storm once more , slowly freezing to death in the snow .
He was a healer , <unk> over loose rocks in the rain , seeking the flashes of color that betrayed rare herbs amid the undergrowth .
He was a boy crouched in his mother ’ s cave , in that place that was a sanctuary from the world but never from her gaze , laden with <unk> .
And night after night , in his dreams , Rygann ’ s Reach burned again .
He was seven years old when he learned the truth of his blood .
His mother crouched before him , turning his face in her hands and looking over the <unk> and bruises marking his skin .
He felt an uneasy flicker of surprise , for she rarely touched him .
“ Who did this to you ? ” she asked , and as he was drawing breath to answer her , she spoke over him with words he was far more used to hearing .
“ What did you do ?
What did you do wrong , to <unk> this punishment ? ” She moved away before he could reply .
He trembled in the wake of her touch on his skin , <unk> to the contact , fearing and <unk> that moment of awkward closeness .
“ Just wrestling , mother .
In the village all the boys wrestle .
And the <unk> too . ” She regarded him with a <unk> eye .
“ You didn ’ t get those marks from wrestling , Kegan , ” she muttered .
“ I ’ m not a fool . ” “ There was a fight after the wrestling . ” He wiped his nose on his ragged sleeve , <unk> away a <unk> <unk> .
“ Some of the other boys didn ’ t like me winning .
They got angry . ” His mother was a thin woman — frail in a land that devoured the weak .
She was old before her time , a victim of <unk> sorrows and the <unk> brought about by her <unk> .
Even at seven , Kegan knew all of this .
He was a <unk> child .
This was the <unk> of having a mage for a mother .
As he looked up at her , framed as she was by the mouth of the cave they called home , he saw a softness in her eyes that was as unfamiliar as the touch on his face had been a moment before .
He thought she might sink back to her knees before him and draw him into an embrace , and the thought <unk> him as much as he <unk> for it .
Instead , her dark eyes frosted over .
“ What have I told you about <unk> the other children ?
You ’ ll just make our lives even harder if the village <unk> you , Kegan . ” “ But they started it . ” She stopped , <unk> , and looked back down at him .
Her expression was as dark and cold as her eyes .
The younger gaze lifted to meet hers was pale green , like she so often told him his father ’ s had been .
“ And you started it all the other times .
Your temper , Kegan … ” “ No , I didn ’ t , ” the boy lied .
“ Not every time , at least . ” His mother moved further back into the cave , <unk> by the <unk> , stirring the <unk> broth of boiled elnük fat that would serve as their <unk> for the next three nights .
“ There ’ s magic in our blood .
In our bones .
In our breath .
We have to be careful , in ways other people don ’ t . ” “ But — ” “ You shouldn ’ t cause trouble in the village .
We already live here on their <unk> .
Old Rygann has been good to us , letting us stay here . ” <unk> moved Kegan ’ s mouth before he had time to think .
“ We live in a cave in the rocks , far from the village , ” he said .
“ You should stop healing them if they ’ re so bad to us .
We should leave . ” “ You don ’ t know what you ’ re talking about , Kegan .
I <unk> because I have the power to do it , and we stay because we have to stay . ” She nodded to the hillside where the trees were blackened by the night , and <unk> by the moon .
“ We ’ d die out there , where the woods become ice and snow , all the way to the world ’ s end .
Let them say whatever they want to say .
Don ’ t stir up trouble .
Don ’ t stir up the magic in your blood . ” But the boy stood still at the <unk> of the cave .
“ If they say bad things about me , or they fight me … I ’ ll fight back .
I ’ m not a coward like you . ” This night would become a memory <unk> forever into his mind because of what came next .
For the first time , he didn ’ t bow his head and promise to obey her .
Instead , he clenched his little fists , and narrowed his eyes .
In the silence that stretched between mother and son , he expected a <unk> — one of her <unk> cracks against his cheek that would somehow sting for about an hour <unk> — or maybe yet more <unk> .
His mother cried a lot , quiet and alone , long into the night when she thought he was asleep .
But this time , there was something new in her eyes .
Something fearful .
“ You are your father ’ s son . ” The words were calm and <unk> , and somehow all the worse for it .
“ His eyes , always looking at me .
His crime , always there to remind me .
And now his words , his spite , thrown in my face . ” The boy gazed up at her in awed , <unk> fury .
“ Is that why you hate me ? ” She hesitated before answering , and that meant more than any answer ever could .
It was that hesitation he never forgot , even years later , long after her <unk> bones were naught but ash and dust on a <unk> funeral pyre .
He was thirteen when he first saw Zvanna .
She came to Rygann ’ s Reach with two dozen others , the survivors of a <unk> clan that had dwindled in the wilds over the course of a <unk> .
<unk> than take to raiding like so many others , they settled in the Reach , bringing fresh blood , skills , and spears to the people of the <unk> fishing village .
Kegan met her one day in the <unk> of the setting sun .
He was picking <unk> and herbs in the southern hills , stripping the <unk> of thorns before <unk> them into his <unk> satchel .
It was a slow task when done right , and Kegan ’ s fingers were <unk> in a hundred places from his <unk> .
At one point he looked up , and there she was .
He stopped working .
He rose to his feet , brushing dirt from his <unk> hands , with no idea how curiosity and surprise looked like suspicion on his otherwise fine features .
You would be handsome , his mother had once said , if you could stop glaring at the world as if you want to <unk> yourself upon it .
“ Who are you ? ” he asked .
She flinched at the question , and even to his own ears he sounded <unk> .
“ I mean , you ’ re one of the newcomers .
I know that .
What ’ s your name ?
What are you doing out here ?
Are you lost ? ” The questions rained on the girl like flung stones .
She was older than him , though by no more than a year or two .
<unk> , <unk> , practically drowning in her heavy furs , she stared back at him as she spoke .
She had the voice of a <unk> .
“ Are you the healer ’ s boy ? ” He smiled , <unk> all teeth and no <unk> .
For the first time in years , he felt the ache of knowing that they talked ill of him in the village .
Here was someone new to his world , and it was someone who had already heard a hundred dark things about him .
“ Kegan , ” he replied .
He swallowed , and sought to soften his words .
“ Yes , I ’ m the healer ’ s boy , ” he added with a nod .
“ Who are you ? ” “ Zvanna .
Can you come ?
My father is <unk> . ” Kegan ’ s heart sank .
He found himself <unk> his voice lower , as if she were a <unk> beast he didn ’ t want to <unk> away .
“ I ’ m not a healer .
Not like my mother . ” The <unk> was like having a tooth pulled .
“ I just help her . ” “ She ’ s on her way to the village , ” the girl said .
“ She told me to find you .
You have the herbs she needs . ” Kegan cursed as he buckled his bag into place .
He started towards her , moving lightly over the dark earth and <unk> .
“ I ’ ll come now .
Who ’ s your father ?
What ’ s wrong with him ? ” “ He ’ s a sailmaker , ” Zvanna replied , leading the way back to the Reach .
“ He can ’ t eat or drink .
His stomach <unk> . ” “ My mother will know what to do . ” Kegan spoke in the tones of absolute confidence as he followed her across the hillside , descending towards the village .
<unk> , he felt a <unk> every time she glanced back at him , and he wondered just what she ’ d heard from the other children of the village .
He didn ’ t have to wonder for long .
She spoke gently , without judgement .
“ Old Rygann said you ’ re a <unk> ’ s son .
A reaver-bastard . ” <unk> was taking hold around them with the setting of the sun .
Kegan showed no emotion at all .
“ Old Rygann said the truth . ” “ Does that really make you bad luck ?
Like the legends say ? ” “ <unk> which legends you believe … ” Kegan considered that a cunning enough answer , but she twisted it back at him a moment later .
“ Which legends do you believe ? ” she asked , looking over her shoulder .
He met her eyes in the <unk> , and felt the force of her gentle gaze like an axe to the gut .
None of them , he thought .
They ’ re all fears held by foolish men and women , afraid of true magic .
“ I don ’ t know , ” he said .
She had no response for that .
She did , however , have another question .
“ If your mother is a healer , why aren ’ t you ? ” Because the magic doesn ’ t work for me , he almost said aloud , but thought better of it .
“ Because I want to be a warrior . ” Zvanna kept ahead of him , her tread light across the icy rocks .
“ But there are no warriors here .
Only hunters . ” “ Well .
I want to be a warrior . ” “ People need <unk> more than warriors , ” she pointed out .
“ Oh ? ” Kegan spat into the undergrowth .
“ Then why do shamans have no friends ? ” He knew the answer to that .
He ’ d heard it enough .
People are frightened of me , his mother always said .
But Zvanna had a different answer .
“ If you help my father , I ’ ll be your friend . ” He was <unk> when he broke Erach ’ s jaw .
Sixteen , and already possessing a man ’ s size and muscle .
Sixteen , and all too familiar when it came to <unk> a point with his fists .
His mother warned him about it , time and again , and now Zvanna did the same .
“ Your temper , Kegan … ” she would say , in the same tone as his mother .
In his <unk> year , the solstice celebration was a <unk> <unk> , a louder and brighter celebration than usual with the arrival of a merchant <unk> and three string <unk> from Valar ’ s Hollow , far to the <unk> .
<unk> were made by the shore , and promises of eternal love spoken <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
<unk> warriors <unk> to <unk> the <unk> locals watching from the sides .
<unk> were broken and mended , <unk> <unk> and settled .
<unk> broke out over <unk> , over <unk> , over matters of <unk> .
The abundance of drink only added to the atmosphere of <unk> .
Many were the <unk> that came with the pale , winter ’ s dawn , when the clarity of the <unk> <unk> returned through fading <unk> .
But the fight between Kegan and Erach was like no other .
<unk> in sweat from the <unk> , Kegan looked for Zvanna by the <unk> .
Had she seen him perform ?
Had she watched him leave the other young men of the village <unk> , unable to keep up with his wild leaps ?
His mother was a <unk> wraith in her <unk> cloak .
Her hair was ragged , with the trinkets and talismans of bone tied into the <unk> strands resting against her cheeks .
She gripped his wrist .
The solstice was one of the few nights their presence was <unk> in the village , and his mother had made the journey with him .
“ Where ’ s Zvanna ? ” he asked her .
“ Kegan , ” she warned him as she held his wrist .
“ I want you to be calm . ” The heat of the flames and the sweat on his skin no longer existed .
His blood was frost .
His bones were ice .
“ Where ’ s Zvanna ? ” he asked again , this time in a growl .
His mother started to explain , but he didn ’ t need her to .
Somehow , he knew .
Perhaps it was nothing more than a flash of <unk> through his dawning temper .
Or perhaps it was — as the sorcerer would later say — a flicker of <unk> from his <unk> magical gifts .
Whatever the truth , he shoved his mother aside .
He went down to the waves where young <unk> stood with their families , <unk> by winter flowers , <unk> oaths to stay loyal and loving for the rest of their lives .
<unk> started up as he drew near .
He ignored them .
They became <unk> as he forced his way through the crowd , and he ignored those , too .
He wasn ’ t too late .
That was what mattered .
There was still time .
“ Zvanna ! ” All eyes turned to him , though hers was the only gaze that mattered .
He saw the joy die in her eyes as she <unk> the look upon his face .
The crown of white winter <unk> was at odds with her black hair .
He wanted to <unk> it from her head .
The young man at her side moved <unk> in front of her , but she eased him aside to <unk> Kegan herself .
“ Don ’ t do this , Kegan .
My father arranged it .
I could have refused , if I wanted to .
Please don ’ t do this .
Not now . ” “ But you ’ re mine . ” He reached for her hand .
She wasn ’ t fast enough to draw away — that , or she knew it would spark him further if she tried .
“ I ’ m not yours , ” she said softly .
They stood in the center of the crowd , as if they were the ones about to be bound together in the sight of the gods .
“ I ’ m not anyone ’ s .
But I ’ m accepting Malvir ’ s pledge . ” Kegan could have <unk> with it , if that was all it had been .
The <unk> meant nothing to him , for what was a fleeting , <unk> humiliation to one that had endured nothing but shame for most of his life ?
He could ’ ve walked away right then , or even — against every desire and prayer — stayed in the crowd and lied his way through the laughter and the <unk> and the <unk> .
He would ’ ve done that for her .
Not easily , no , but willingly .
Anything for Zvanna .
He was already releasing her , <unk> a false smile and drawing breath to <unk> , when the hand slammed down on his shoulder .
“ Leave her alone , boy . ” Old Rygann ’ s voice , cracked with age , cut through the silence .
This was a man , the <unk> of the settlement , who looked like he ’ d been old when the world was still young .
He was at least <unk> , likely closer to <unk> , and though it wasn ’ t his hand holding Kegan back , he <unk> the men that surrounded the healer ’ s son now .
“ You get out of here , reaver-bastard , before you bring yet more misfortune down on all of us . ” The hand tried to haul him back , but Kegan stood firm .
He was not a boy .
He had a man ’ s strength now .
“ Don ’ t touch me , ” he said through clenched teeth .
Whatever was on his face caused Zvanna to back away .
Other hands joined the first , dragging him away from her , making him stumble .
And , as always , instinct was there to catch him .
He turned , he roared , and he swung at the closest of the men hauling him away .
Zvanna ’ s father went down in a <unk> heap , his jaw shattered .
Kegan walked away .
Others in the crowd cried out or hurled insults , but none sought to bar his passage , or come after him .
There was satisfaction in that .
<unk> , even .
He cuffed at the corners of his eyes on the way home , refusing to cry , and <unk> soothed by the sweet pain in his throbbing knuckles .
He was nineteen when he burned his mother on her funeral pyre , and spread her ashes along the hillside overlooking Rygann ’ s Reach the following morning .
He knew he would have to have to bear the burden alone , despite all his mother had done for the village .
For all that they had feared her , they ’ d needed her and valued her And yet here he was , casting her remains to the bitter winds with a prayer to the <unk> <unk> , alone but for his thoughts .
He imagined them in the village , and if they acknowledged his mother ’ s death at all it was with a selfish eye to their own suffering .
They ’ d be worried now , with the healer gone .
They couldn ’ t <unk> on her son to step up , after all .
The <unk> chain had been broken when his raiding father had <unk> him , pouring misfortune into a mage ’ s blood .
Right now , those people would all be <unk> their useless <unk> about his mother , maybe even <unk> themselves that a few kind words uttered far too late severed them from the guilt and <unk> of how they had treated her in life .
Far more likely , they were quietly celebrating the passing of a shadow from their lives .
<unk> animals , all of them .
Only three of them came out from the village at all , and they hadn ’ t made the journey to say their <unk> .
Zvanna approached him after the lonely ceremony was over — but her son , with the same black hair as his mother , refused to come near Kegan .
The boy , now almost three , stayed at his father ’ s side a short distance away .
“ The little one is scared of me , ” Kegan observed without <unk> .
Zvanna hesitated , just as Kegan ’ s mother had once hesitated , setting the truth in his mind .
“ He ’ s heard stories , ” she admitted .
“ I ’ m sure he has . ” He tried to keep his tone <unk> .
“ What do you want ? ” She kissed his cheek .
“ I ’ m sorry for your loss , Kegan .
She was a kind soul . ” <unk> wasn ’ t a word he connected with his mother , but now was hardly to the time to argue .
“ Yes , ” he said .
“ She was .
But what did you really come to say ?
We were friends once .
I can tell when you ’ re holding something back . ” She didn ’ t smile as she replied .
“ Old Rygann … He ’ s going to ask you to leave . ” Kegan <unk> his chin .
He was too weary that day to feel anything , least of all surprise .
He didn ’ t need to ask why Rygann had come to that decision .
There was still one shadow darkening the edge of the settlement .
One last shadow that would finally fade away .
“ So the <unk> boy can ’ t <unk> nearby , now his mother ’ s dead , ” he spat onto the <unk> earth .
“ At least she was <unk> , right ?
She was the one with the magic . ” “ I ’ m sorry , Kegan . ” For a brief time , together on the hillside , things were just as they had been a few short years ago .
She leeched the angry heat from his heart just by being near , and he breathed in the cold air , <unk> every urge to reach out for her .
“ You should go , ” he muttered , and nodded towards Malvir and the young boy .
“ Your family is waiting . ” “ Where will you go ? ” she asked .
She drew her furs tighter around herself .
“ What will you do ? ” His mother ’ s words echoed down the years .
We ’ d die out there , where the woods become ice and snow , all the way to the world ’ s end ... “ I ’ ll find my father , ” he replied .
She looked at him , troubled .
He could see the doubt in her eyes , and worse , the fear .
The fear that he might be <unk> .
“ You don ’ t mean that , Kegan .
You don ’ t even know who your father ’ s people are , or where they <unk> from , or … or anything .
How would you ever hope to find him ? ” “ I ’ ll try , at least . ” Kegan resisted the urge to spit again .
Even an impossible ambition sounded better than I don ’ t know what I ’ ll do , Zvanna .
I ’ ll probably die alone on the ice .
She was drawing breath to fight him on it , even after all these years of little more than silence , but he hushed her with a shake of his head .
“ I ’ ll come see you before I leave .
We ’ ll talk then .
I ’ ll be down in the village tomorrow , for supplies .
I ’ ll need things for my journey . ” Zvanna hesitated again , and he knew .
Kegan knew it as if the <unk> had whispered it to him on the wind .
“ Old Rygann has forbidden it , ” he sighed .
The words weren ’ t a question , or even a guess .
“ I ’ m not <unk> down into the Reach .
Not even to trade before I go . ” She pressed a small satchel against his chest , and that <unk> it .
He could guess what would be in there : dried <unk> , and whatever meager provisions her young family could spare .
The <unk> of unfamiliar gratitude left him shaking and almost — almost — accepting the gift .
But he <unk> it back to her .
“ I ’ ll be fine , ” he promised her .
“ Don ’ t worry about me .
I ’ ll be fine . ” That night , he went into Rygann ’ s Reach alone .
He carried a week ’ s worth of supplies in his pack , an ivory spear in his hand , and his hair was woven with his mother ’ s bone <unk> .
He looked as much a <unk> shaman as she ever had , though he carried himself with a warrior ’ s bulk , and moved with a hunter ’ s <unk> .
<unk> was still three hours distant .
Here , in the <unk> part of the night , Kegan stalked with <unk> care , moving between the <unk> <unk> of the families that had <unk> him and his mother for all of his short , harsh life .
He felt no malice toward them , not anymore — the old anger was reduced to embers , alive but banked , burning low .
If he felt anything more , it was a <unk> and exhausted sense of <unk> .
They were simple .
They were <unk> to their <unk> .
No , his true hatred was reserved for one soul above all others .
Old Rygann ’ s <unk> sat <unk> in the settlement ’ s heart .
Kegan drew near , avoiding the <unk> gazes of the <unk> by staying in the shadows cast by the descending moon .
<unk> was a <unk> duty , and they treated it with all the <unk> one would expect .
Why should they expect any trouble from the naked tundra , or the bare ocean ?
No raiders had landed at Rygann ’ s Reach for a long time , after all .
Kegan <unk> inside .
Old Rygann awoke to find a shadow crouched at the foot of his bed .
In the shadow ’ s pale eyes were <unk> of reflected moonlight , and in the shadow ’ s hands was an ivory knife — a ritual dagger last carried by <unk> Rodhe , the <unk> that had died only days before .
It was a blade that had been used , so it was said , for blood sacrifices .
The shadow smiled , and spoke in a low , feral whisper .
“ If you make a single sound without my <unk> , old man , you die . ” In the <unk> gloom , Rygann could have passed for a hundred years old .
His <unk> <unk> from the reek of lantern oil , and the animal <unk> of the intruder ’ s sweat .
He nodded in helpless obedience .
The shadow leaned forward , and the reaver-bastard Kegan ’ s face <unk> , coldly amused , from the darkness .
“ I ’ m going to tell you something , old man .
And you will listen to me , if for no other reason that it lets you live a little longer . ” The dagger , carved from a drüvask tooth , glinted in the <unk> .
Kegan rested the tip , carved to a <unk> point , on the man ’ s <unk> throat .
“ <unk> if you understand . ” Rygann nodded , wisely mute .
“ Good . ” Kegan kept the knife in place .
His eyes were liquid with hatred , his teeth almost trembling with the force of his anger .
He was a creature on the edge of savagery , held back only by tattered shreds of humanity .
Rygann swallowed hard , saying nothing .
He was shaking himself , for far different <unk> .
“ You killed my mother , ” Kegan growled .
“ It wasn ’ t the disease that ate her away from within .
It was you .
You killed her , day by day , with your mistrust and your <unk> .
You killed her by <unk> her to the cold comfort of that cave .
You killed her by banishing her on the whims of your stupid superstition . ” The blade rested on the old man ’ s cheek , ready to saw through the flesh .
“ And now you ’ re killing me , ” Kegan added softly .
“ It wasn ’ t enough to shame me for the sin of my father ’ s blood , and curse me for being bad luck .
It wasn ’ t enough to <unk> a child out of your precious village , over and over , and teach me nothing except how to hate others .
Now , while the embers of my mother ’ s funeral pyre are still warm , you want to damn me to <unk> the wasteland , to die . ” And then the dagger was gone .
The intruder slipped from the bed , edging back across the room .
Kegan ’ s smile became a grin , scarcely illuminated by the shuttered lantern he held up from the bedchamber ’ s table .
“ That ’ s all I came to say .
I want you to think about those words when I ’ m gone .
I want you to think of the boy you helped to raise by throwing him and his mother out into the cold . ” Rygann didn ’ t know how to respond , or if the healer ’ s son even <unk> a reply .
He stayed silent out of a healthy blend of wisdom and fear , breathing in the <unk> , oily scent that filled the room .
Kegan <unk> the lantern , and a sudden amber glow spread across the room .
<unk> of <unk> <unk> marked the floorboards , the walls , the shelves , even the <unk> .
The intruder had done his work well — in silence — before waking his prey .
“ <unk> , ” the old man stammered , <unk> with dawning panic .
“ Wait — ” “ No , I have a journey to make , ” Kegan said , almost <unk> , “ and I should warm my hands before I go .
<unk> , Rygann . ” “ Wait !
Please ! ” But Kegan didn ’ t wait .
He was backing away towards the door , and tossed the lantern like a parting gift .
It smashed on the rough floorboards of the bedchamber .
The world ignited , and Kegan laughed even as the flames licked at his own flesh .
Fire is like a living thing , <unk> and ravenous .
It has its own hunger , its own whims , and — like fate — its own vile sense of humor .
It leapt in caressing <unk> , as sparks that were carried by the Freljord ’ s hateful wind , dancing across nearby rooftops .
Everywhere that it touched , it bit down and devoured .
Kegan cut north , heading through the <unk> <unk> , blind to the <unk> in his wake .
He had more pressing matters than waiting to see if Old Rygann ’ s hall would burn all the way to the ground .
He had the seared ruin of his face to deal with ; a screaming , searing wash of pain <unk> the left side of his features , soothed only by pressing his flesh into the snowy earth .
Not for the first time , he wondered if there might not be something to all the talk of the ill-fortune in his blood .
By the time he reached high enough ground to turn back and witness the results of his handiwork , the sun was rising above the ocean , and the fire had long since been reduced down to a <unk> of thick smoke , curling and <unk> in the mercy of the morning winds .
He held a <unk> of ice against his burned cheek , hoping to see Rygann ’ s hall as a charred , black heart in the center of the village .
What he saw instead stopped his breath .
<unk> with horror , scarred by <unk> , and <unk> in an awkward run , the betrayer made his way back to the scene of his betrayal .
At first , no one marked his return .
The survivors wandered among the charred skeletons of their homes , where all they owned was now gone .
He was just one more silhouette in the smoky haze , one more scarred face among those that still lived .
He found Zvanna outside the blackened remains of her hut .
She ’ d been laid carefully on the earth with her son and husband , the three of them silent and still beneath the same <unk> blanket .
Kegan crouched beside them for an unknown time , his skull empty of thought , his body empty of strength .
Perhaps he wept .
He wasn ’ t sure — not then , and not after — though he felt the sting of salt upon his wounded cheek .
He could only remember two things for certain , in his time at her side .
The first was the sight of the family ’ s faces when he pulled the sheet back , to be certain it was them .
When he had his answer , he covered them again .
The second was resting his <unk> hands on the filthy shroud , pleading for his mother ’ s old magic to work through him .
He <unk> no more in that moment than he ever had , when seeking to draw upon his supposed gifts .
They stayed dead .
He stayed broken .
Some time later , of course , the others came for him .
Kegan stayed on his knees by Zvanna ’ s side as they threw insults and blame , as they <unk> about <unk> and <unk> misfortune , and cursed the day he ’ d been born .
Kegan let it wash over him .
It was nothing against the emptiness in his chest and the <unk> ache of his face .
The survivors had no idea .
They blamed him out of mournful superstition because there was no one else to blame , little knowing the true harm he ’ d done to them all .
They blamed his blood when they should have blamed his <unk> .
Kegan left the razed village without looking back .
He walked out into the <unk> , just as he had <unk> , though the anticipated sense of <unk> was now nothing but ashes in his mouth .
What followed were the weeks of wandering .
Kegan made his way inland , following game <unk> and <unk> , with no destination in mind and no knowledge of what settlements lay where .
The only places he knew well were <unk> <unk> and mountainsides with <unk> herbs his mother had used in her <unk> concoctions .
Even the closest settlement , Valar ’ s Hollow , was weeks away , and likely to be the new home of any survivors from Rygann ’ s Reach .
If Kegan found his way there , he doubted the welcome would be warm .
Far <unk> , it would be fatal .
He hunted when he could , though he lacked a true hunter ’ s skills .
Once he <unk> on the <unk> carcass of a <unk> , only to throw the mess back up hours later when his belly <unk> .
The days bled into weeks , and the weeks into a month , and more , as the skies stayed dark and the weather turned foul .
He saw no other <unk> .
He saw no sign of nearby settlements .
He spent hours in a <unk> <unk> , and others in a <unk> trance .
<unk> after day he encountered nothing but the icy <unk> of his homeland — the Freljord cared nothing for whether he lived or died by its howling breath .
<unk> else in the world could teach such a brutal lesson in a man ’ s <unk> .
Fortune , or perhaps a cruel twist of fate , led him to a cave formed from the same pale rock as his mother ’ s sanctuary .
<unk> , weakened from <unk> , scarred by his own fire , Kegan Rodhe lay down on the cold rock , feeling his skin freeze to the stone .
He would lie here and wait for the latest blizzard to die down , or he would lie here and wait to die .
<unk> came first .
But on that night , he met the man who would become his teacher .
His master .
The figure melted out of the storm in a weary <unk> , with his shoulders hunched and head down .
His <unk> was shaggy , and <unk> not with age but from the bite of the frosty winds .
His features were gaunt beneath his hood , and his eyes shimmered with an unnatural <unk> .
<unk> of all was the man ’ s skin , mottled and tattooed — in the storm ’ s light , with each crash of lightning , the flesh looked as though it were darkening to blue .
<unk> , by firelight , it was far more clearly <unk> to violet .
As <unk> fated by destiny went , it was too <unk> for any bard ’ s tale , or saga of old .
No arcane <unk> were made , and no binding <unk> were sworn .
The newcomer had merely stood at the mouth of the cave , turning a <unk> eye on the human wreckage lying before him .
“ What , ” the sorcerer muttered , “ do we have here ? ” Kegan drifted in and out of consciousness , as well as his senses .
When he finally managed to summon words , he accused the older man of being a spirit , or an illusion .
In answer , the sorcerer crouched beside him , offering a hand .
<unk> spread through Kegan from his touch , in a rush of <unk> … life .
It was not the sting of flame , yet the relief it brought was so fierce that it almost broke him .
“ I am neither a phantom nor a <unk> , ” the newcomer had said .
“ My name is Ryze .
And you , dear miserable creature … Who are you ? ” Kegan woke well after dawn , <unk> the grit from his eyes .
It didn ’ t surprise him to see that his master was already up , sitting cross-legged and with his eyes closed .
He was <unk> , the barbarian knew , though he couldn ’ t understand the point of sitting still for an hour a day .
What was it supposed to <unk> ?
It seemed a strange <unk> between sleeping and being awake , to no obvious purpose ... “ Good morning , ” the sorcerer said , without opening his eyes .
“ You did not sleep well , ” he added .
As so often , it was a <unk> and not a question .
Kegan <unk> one <unk> into the ashes of the campfire , and grunted .
“ Why do I feel like you ’ re watching me , even when your eyes are closed ? ” “ Because you ’ re uneasy around others .
It makes you doubt their <unk> . ” Kegan grunted again .
“ There ’ s nothing wrong with a little healthy suspicion . ” Ryze chuckled , remaining motionless in his <unk> <unk> .
Kegan <unk> at that .
“ What ’ s so <unk> ? ” “ I hear myself in your words , sometimes .
The way you turn mistrust into a <unk> is especially familiar to me .
I can ’ t say I blame you , given all you have endured . ” Kegan stared at him .
Can he read my mind ?
Does he see my dreams ... ?
The sorcerer made no response .
Not even a <unk> .
The young barbarian rose , stretching out the night ’ s <unk> with a delicious crackle of sinew .
“ <unk> .
Do you want me to heat the last of the broth , to break our fast ? ” “ <unk> of you , Kegan .
Will you gather <unk> , or use your gifts ? ” The question was loaded , bordering on condescending , and it took no small effort for Kegan to avoid the <unk> .
“ <unk> .
I ’ ll try the magic again later . ” Another chuckle .
Another <unk> chuckle .
“ As you wish , ” Ryze replied .
Kegan took his time finding enough fallen deadwood .
His skull was awhirl with echoes of their <unk> these last few weeks .
Something was <unk> at the back of his brain , something that made the healing burn scars itch across his face .
It was only when he returned to their <unk> camp , and <unk> the <unk> of broken branches , that he realized what it was .
“ Master . ” The sorcerer didn ’ t move , but the air seemed to change around them both .
It became <unk> , somehow — maybe a touch <unk> , charged with some unseen force .
“ Yes ? ” Kegan cleared his throat , fighting for the right way to say it .
“ When you spoke of magic yesterday , you mentioned … You mentioned the stuff of creation . ” Ryze remained motionless , but for his <unk> lips .
“ I did , yes .
Go on . ” Kegan took a breath , struggling with the <unk> of what he wanted to say .
“ Well .
<unk> comes from rain , ice , and the sea .
Fire comes from sparks and <unk> , or from lightning striking the forest .
And those trees that make up the forest , they come from seeds . ” “ All true , to some <unk> .
And <unk> <unk> for this hour of the morning .
What is the <unk> of this <unk> ? ” “ This what ? ” The older man smiled , not <unk> .
“ What are you trying to say , Kegan ? ” “ Just that everything comes from somewhere .
Everything has … a birth .
A source .
Is it the same for magic ?
Does it have a source in the world ? ” Ryze didn ’ t answer at once .
His stillness , to Kegan ’ s eyes , seemed suddenly a thing of <unk> , rather than <unk> .
“ That is an <unk> question , my friend .
There is a purity to your <unk> way of thinking , and I <unk> you for that line of thought .
But it is not a discussion you and I are ready to have . ” The barbarian clenched his teeth , swallowing his temper .
Finally he ’ d asked something worthy of an answer , and his master denied it to him .
“ But I was thinking … If you <unk> the rain , you could make new <unk> .
If you had a thousand seeds , you could plant a new forest .
If you have iron , you can forge an axe .
What if you could control the source of magic ?
You wouldn ’ t need to guide it or <unk> it .
You could command it , after all . ” Ryze opened his eyes .
His gaze was colder than any Freljordian wind .
There was mercy in those eyes , and <unk> , but beneath both of those was a <unk> , sickly hint of fear .
You ’ re afraid , Kegan thought , and his skin crawled at the very idea .
He didn ’ t know why .
He couldn ’ t guess what it was about his words would <unk> that stern , cold dread in his master ’ s soul .
But Kegan knew what fear looked like , in the eyes of others .
He ’ d seen it all his life .
“ Not yet , ” Ryze murmured .
“ When you are ready , we will speak of this .
But not yet . ” Kegan Rodhe nodded , <unk> without understanding , <unk> by the unease in his master ’ s stare .
Fear was a weakness , after all , and <unk> had to be faced .
And <unk> .
= = = = = = <unk> <unk> <unk> = = = = = = = = UNKNOWN = = Ryze would have been cold if his body wasn ’ t <unk> with nervous energy .
With all that weighed on him that day , the harsh Freljordian <unk> scarcely seemed to have an effect .
<unk> was he <unk> by the distant howl of a hungry ice troll .
He had come to do a <unk> .
Not one he relished , but one that had to be done , and one he could no longer avoid .
As he approached the gates , he could hear the rustling of fur cloaks over pine timber as the warriors of the tribe rushed to inspect him .
In seconds , their spears were <unk> atop the gate , ready to kill , should he prove unwelcome .
“ I ’ ve come to see Yago , ” said Ryze , pulling back the hood of his cloak just enough to reveal his violet skin .
“ It ’ s urgent . ” The <unk> faces of the warriors atop the <unk> flashed with surprise at the sight of the Rune Mage .
They climbed down and worked in <unk> to open the heavy hardwood gates , which seemed to <unk> <unk> at the sight of the <unk> .
This was not a place that saw many visitors , and those it did see usually ended up on <unk> as a <unk> to others .
Ryze , on the other hand , had a <unk> that <unk> him <unk> to even the most hostile <unk> of Runeterra — — For a few minutes , <unk> , if no <unk> <unk> , he thought .
His face betrayed none of those <unk> as he walked between the columns of fierce , wind-chapped faces that seemed to judge him , looking for any reason to try him .
A young boy , no more than five , gaped at Ryze , <unk> leaving his grandmother ’ s side for a closer look .
“ Are you a <unk> ? ” asked the boy .
“ Something like that , ” replied Ryze , barely <unk> at the boy as he continued his stride .
He found the path that led toward the rear of the <unk> .
To his surprise , the village had hardly changed since he had last seen it , many years before .
He made his way to an unmistakable structure of <unk> <unk> ice , its brilliant <unk> hue standing out among the dull surroundings of wood and earth .
He was always a wise man .
Maybe he ’ ll <unk> , thought Ryze as he entered the temple , <unk> himself for whatever lay in wait .
Inside , an old frost mage was pouring wine into a <unk> on an <unk> .
He turned to see Ryze approaching , and seemed to judge him silently .
Ryze felt his heart sink in dread .
After a moment , the man smiled , and embraced Ryze like a long-lost brother .
“ You look thin , ” said the mage .
“ You should eat something . ” “ You shouldn ’ t , ” replied Ryze , nodding to Yago ’ s slightly sagging <unk> .
The two friends laughed long and easily , as if they had never been apart .
Ryze slowly felt his guard begin to drop .
There were very few people in the world he would call friend , and it did his soul good to talk to one .
He and Yago spent the next hour <unk> , eating , and catching up .
Ryze had forgotten how good it felt to <unk> with another human being .
He could easily stay a <unk> with Yago , drinking wine and sharing tales of triumph and loss .
“ What brings you so deep into the Freljord ? ” asked Yago at last .
The question jolted Ryze back to reality .
He quickly recalled the words he ’ d carefully prepared for this point in the conversation .
He told a story of his days in Shurima .
He ’ d gone to investigate a tribe of <unk> that had swelled in wealth and land , to the size of a small kingdom , almost overnight .
On closer <unk> , Ryze found a World Rune in their possession .
They resisted , and … Ryze lowered his tone to suit the silence of the room .
He explained that sometimes awful things must be done for the world to remain <unk> .
Sometimes those awful things are better than the horrible <unk> that would otherwise <unk> .
“ They must be kept safe , ” said Ryze , finally coming to his point .
“ All of them . ” Yago nodded <unk> , and the warmth that had been <unk> between the two friends instantly <unk> .
“ You would take it from us , knowing it is all that keeps the trolls away ? ” asked Yago .
“ You knew this would come , ” said Ryze , offering no <unk> .
“ You ’ ve known for years . ” “ Give us more time .
In the spring , we will head south .
What chance do we have in winter ? ” “ You ’ ve said those words before , ” Ryze said coldly .
To his surprise , Yago took him by the hands , making a gentle plea .
“ There are many children among us .
And three of our women are swollen with child .
You would doom us all ? ” asked Yago desperately .
“ How many are in this village ? ” asked Ryze .
“ <unk> , ” replied Yago .
“ And how many are in the world ? ” Yago fell silent .
“ It can wait no longer .
Dark forces gather to take it .
It leaves with me today , ” Ryze demanded .
“ You would use it for yourself , ” accused Yago , erupting in a jealous rage .
Ryze looked into Yago ’ s face to see that it had been <unk> into a <unk> visage — that of a <unk> , no longer recognizable as the man Ryze once had once known .
Ryze started to explain that he had learned long ago not to use the <unk> , that doing so would always come with too high a <unk> .
But he could tell this madman before him was not one to be <unk> with .
Suddenly , Ryze felt a severe pain , and found himself writhing on the floor , saliva dripping from his mouth .
He looked up to see Yago in a casting stance , his fingers crackling with power that no mortal being should possess .
Coming to his senses , Ryze <unk> the frost mage in place with a ring of arcane power , giving himself just enough time to get to his feet .
Ryze and Yago circled each other , clashing with powers the world had not seen in <unk> .
Yago seared Ryze ’ s flesh with what felt like the power of twenty <unk> .
Ryze countered with a <unk> series of arcane bursts .
After what seemed like hours , the combined power of their <unk> breached the walls of the temple , and brought the thick ice <unk> crumbling down upon them .
<unk> wounded , Ryze dug himself out of the rubble and got to his knees .
He saw a blurred image of Yago , battered , and fumbling to open a <unk> that he ’ d dug out of the debris .
Ryze could tell by the lust in his eyes what he was reaching for , and what would surely happen once he had it .
With his magic energy drained , Ryze leapt on the back of his old friend and began to <unk> him with the belt from his own robe .
He felt nothing ; the man who he had loved deeply just minutes ago was now merely a task in need of <unk> .
Yago struggled <unk> , his legs flailing , searching for a <unk> .
Then he fell dead .
Ryze pulled a key from Yago ’ s <unk> and unlocked the box .
He removed the World Rune , its otherworldly pulse beating with a warm <unk> glow .
<unk> the Rune in a scrap of his dead <unk> ’ s robe , he gingerly placed it in his satchel and <unk> out of the temple , breathing a mournful sigh at the loss of another friend .
The Rune Mage limped toward the village gate , past the same wind-chapped faces that had watched him <unk> .
He looked <unk> at them , <unk> an attack , but the villagers made no move to stop him .
These were no longer fierce <unk> ; these were people who looked stunned to be facing their own end .
They looked at Ryze with big , helpless eyes .
“ What are we to do ? ” asked the grandmother , with the young boy still clutching her furs .
“ I ’ d leave , ” said Ryze .
He knew if they stayed , the trolls would <unk> on the village come <unk> , leaving none alive .
And outside the village , worse dangers lurked .
“ Can ’ t we come with you ? ” called the young boy .
Ryze paused .
Part of him — a <unk> of <unk> compassion deep within — screamed , Take them .
<unk> them .
<unk> about the rest of the world .
But he knew he couldn ’ t .
Ryze trudged into the deep Freljordian snow , choosing not to look back at the faces of those he was leaving .
For these were the faces of the dead , and his business was with those who could still be saved .
= = = = = = THE <unk> OF THE <unk> <unk> = = = = = = = = UNKNOWN = = Of all the tales of the old Freljord that have somehow endured into the <unk> age , there is one — and one alone — that can chill the blood of even the <unk> Iceborn .
The Frostguard do not tell it .
Many of them do not even know it , in full .
By decree of the Ice Witch Lissandra herself , to <unk> this forbidden legend is <unk> against the true faith , and <unk> the <unk> of death for any who speak it aloud .
In all the vast <unk> of the Frostguard <unk> , only a single written account remains — and that was <unk> by her most trusted scribe , many thousands of years ago .
Few indeed are those <unk> across Runeterra who know the truth behind the legend , and Lissandra can count on the fingers of one hand those who were there in person and might dare to <unk> her … It was in the final , dark days of the War of the Three <unk> that Avarosa and Serylda finally marched their warriors up into the mountains , to face Lissandra before the walls of her own fortress .
They would not serve the otherworldly masters that she had pledged them to .
This would be an end to it .
The Ice Witch gestured to the armies they led , the great <unk> that had finally brought these wild lands to heel .
The mortal Iceborn were all but <unk> to the winter ’ s chill .
The troll kings had <unk> far across the tundra , <unk> tremendous wealth from their <unk> .
Even the magnificent and terrible <unk> , twisted far beyond their original form , moved now at the command of the Three .
All of this , Lissandra reminded her sisters , was because of the bargain she had made with the masters of the realm below — the beings she knew as Watchers .
It was they who had revealed to her the primal secrets of the world .
It was they who would have the final victory .
And it was then , at the height of this bitter <unk> , that the Watchers finally came to Runeterra .
The ground split open , swallowing thousands of warriors into the abyss beneath it , before the first of the dread things heaved itself up into existence .
It was new to the <unk> realm , <unk> by such <unk> as form and <unk> , and began immediately to <unk> against them .
In a foul <unk> of unchecked metamorphosis , it <unk> horns , and patches of fur , and its colossal <unk> limbs grew into jointed humanoid arms with fingers that clawed the bare rock of the mountainsides .
<unk> of all , other Watchers were following <unk> in its wake , <unk> by <unk> transformations of their own .
It might be fair to <unk> there was a battle , that the Iceborn <unk> behind Avarosa and Serylda to fight back the darkness — but in truth , it was Lissandra who ended it .
She saw these <unk> now for what they were , and knew what had to be done .
<unk> every last <unk> of the ancient magic around her , <unk> that of her allies , she sacrificed everything to seal the <unk> with True Ice , <unk> the Watchers within it .
<unk> plumes of freezing vapor howled through the chasm , and those mortal warriors who managed to escape were driven to insanity by what they had witnessed .
This , then , is not only the legend of how Lissandra saved the world from destruction , but also the only <unk> account of the <unk> of Avarosa and Serylda .
And may the Three have mercy upon all who read it .
= = = = = = <unk> FOR THE <unk> = = = = = = = = ODIN AUSTIN SHAFER = = Across the frozen river , the distant , glowing lights promised warmth and food .
Udyr imagined a hearth fire crackling inside one of the city ’ s homes .
Around the fire , bedding furs rested , <unk> with warmth .
The loud crack of river ice shook the shaman from his <unk> .
Udyr cursed and shivered .
The <unk> had soaked his furs , and the setting sun already hinted at a dangerous freeze coming .
It was going to be difficult to convince Sejuani to change course .
He wasn ’ t looking forward to continuing that conversation , or to <unk> the rest of her army .
In the valley below him , the bulk of Sejuani ’ s host approached .
Through victory , the Winter ’ s Claw tribe had absorbed dozens of clans and all of the <unk> <unk> tribe .
Sejuani was a true Warmother now — <unk> thousands of <unk> warriors , <unk> , mammoth riders , and Iceborn .
Ahead of the main force , the warriors of Sejuani ’ s vanguard were <unk> yurts to house her bloodsworn and to serve as the command <unk> for the army ’ s <unk> .
Sejuani ’ s tent , marked with blue <unk> and covered in <unk> leather , loomed over the center of the encampment .
As Udyr approached , <unk> slithered down his long jaws , and his teeth <unk> with bottomless hunger .
The feeling seemed his own before he spotted a <unk> <unk> past .
He snarled at the dog , struggling to <unk> control of his own jaw and rid himself of the animal ’ s <unk> consciousness .
He found Sejuani helping her bloodsworn build a yurt .
Udyr smiled in pride .
This was her way .
No matter the work , she led from the front .
<unk> these <unk> <unk> in the soaked earth was a <unk> task .
As Sejuani slammed a <unk> into the mud , she stumbled to one knee .
<unk> , bloodsworn warriors struggled in the icy rain , with curses echoing hers .
Watching Sejuani pull herself to her feet , Udyr was struck once more by how she ’ d grown into a <unk> <unk> .
He would never be able to think of her as anything but the <unk> girl he ’ d met a so many <unk> ago ; he wasn ’ t sure he wanted to .
She had so desperately needed his <unk> then .
In perhaps only a few more years , Udyr worried , he would become a useless burden to her .
“ The weather ended this discussion , Udyr , ” she shouted over the <unk> .
“ The Vargkin tribe are a few days west of here , ” Udyr began .
“ We could avoid crossing the river , take them by surprise and — ” The minds of a dozen passing horses filled Udyr ’ s head .
He felt their frozen muscles tightening as they shivered in the cold .
Udyr snapped at the <unk> horse , “ <unk> it !
No <unk> now ! ” <unk> <unk> , Sejuani ’ s bloodsworn <unk> nervous glances .
Sejuani gave her men a look of warning .
<unk> they returned to work .
Even they did not have the right to question her shaman ’ s strangeness .
<unk> his hands behind his back , Udyr gently took a small spike made of silver from a hidden pouch .
He pushed the metal nail against the flesh of his palm .
<unk> the relief of meditation , but the metal ’ s pain cleared his mind , <unk> him to focus on speaking like a human .
“ The Vargkin are only a <unk> march , ” Udyr snorted , “ no walls around their villages . ” Sejuani let his eyes settle before <unk> .
“ We ’ re out of time , Udyr . ” Sejuani <unk> the sagging yurts around her .
“ We must take that city across the river or freeze ! ” She gestured to a few of her older warriors nearby , “ Most of the long <unk> skip <unk> to feed their young .
<unk> , I helped <unk> bury her daughter . ” Sejuani ’ s lips , purple from the cold , tightened <unk> .
“ The child was two summers , but as small and frail as one on its first spring . ” She exhaled and looked away before continuing .
“ I will not be responsible for another child growing too thin to survive the cold . ” “ Then attack now . ” Udyr said pointing toward the distant city across the river .
“ Trust in our axes and muscle .
<unk> and teeth .
The old way . ” “ The old way is to use the best warriors , ” she interrupted .
“ What clan or tribe do I know stronger than the Ursine ?
How many of us would die crossing that river without their help ?
I will not watch my army <unk> from hunger , not when I promised my people strength and victory . ” She steadied Udyr ’ s shoulder , “ I know you have good reason to fear what they — ” “ <unk> ’ s army is what I fear , ” Udyr countered .
“ New clans bend their knee to your rival ’ s <unk> every day .
Each moon , the <unk> <unk> whole tribes .
You say you want to make the Winter ’ s Claw stronger ?
If we work with the Ursine … there will be no <unk> .
No warriors to be reborn as <unk> .
The Lost Ones won ’ t stop until they kill every living thing in that town . ” “ Our name is Winter ’ s Claw .
They are our <unk> . ” She explained , “ I called this war , and we stop when I — ” “ The Ursine do not obey ! ” More than the pain from the silver he held , it was Udyr ’ s certainty that finally cleared his mind .
His voice lowered .
“ Their <unk> spreads like a sickness .
It will consume us . ” “ I have valued your advice my whole life , ” Sejuani said , as she considered his words .
“ But we must overwhelm that city tomorrow , ” she concluded .
“ You ’ ve beaten odds worse than this . ” Udyr lost his train of thought as the consciousness of <unk> , horses , <unk> , men , and elnük flowed through him .
He fought against it , knowing this would be his last chance to change her mind .
“ Sejuani , ” he said finally , “ Kalkia had many <unk> .
She was too <unk> to <unk> , too quick to see defeat .
I know how badly your mother failed you .
But it was your grandmother who was our tribe ’ s true coward , afraid of ever looking weak .
<unk> of — ” “ You will not speak ill of Hejian , ” she warned .
“ Even Kalkia was <unk> enough to avoid your grandmother ’ s <unk> . ” As he spoke , Udyr knew he had crossed a line .
“ Was it a mistake for Hejian to take me from mother ? ” Sejuani ’ s eyes flashed in anger .
“ Would it be better if I became a southern <unk> , like my mother ?
Should I have laid on a throne as she did ?
My legs open and my belly full of mead ?
<unk> in a fight , unworthy of <unk> . ” Sejuani <unk> coldly .
“ The only mistake my grandmother made was <unk> my mother ’ s rule . ” “ Hejian raised you for her own ambitions . ” “ And I honor her for that .
” Any closeness and <unk> Sejuani had shown Udyr was gone .
“ I will call the Lost Ones .
You may help <unk> with the Ursine , or you may <unk> in this storm . ” Udyr ’ s hopes sank .
“ Then I should leave , ” he said <unk> his defeat .
“ The Hounded Lord wouldn ’ t be happy to see me . ” And Udyr had no desire for that unhappy <unk> either .
Sejuani ’ s face transformed , <unk> before she gave a cunning smile .
“ No , ” she grinned .
“ That ’ s exactly why I need you with me , old friend . ” Above him , the <unk> ’ s leaves were the color of blood .
Watching a <unk> leaf fall , Udyr realized how badly he ’ d misunderstood the color red .
In his homeland , he had only seen its hue splashed against the white snow .
In the Freljord , red was the color of violence .
In the Freljord , red was the color of death ’ s approach .
But in truth , it was the color of life .
As long as they lived , every man and beast carried it with them .
Udyr opened his eyes .
The light of his meditation <unk> burned a red spot into his vision .
Rain hissed against the weakening flame of his campfire .
<unk> shook the hut ’ s sagging leather walls , promising to <unk> them before the night ended .
On the ground around him , a thin stream of freezing water flowed between the hides of his yurt ’ s floor .
He wasn ’ t sitting with monks on a <unk> in the foreign lands of Ionia ; he was on the edge of Sejuani ’ s camp .
This is my home , he thought with bitter pride .
It ’ d been weeks since Udyr had <unk> <unk> , but there wasn ’ t time to dwell on it .
As his current surroundings came into focus … the voices returned .
The <unk> cacophony <unk> the breath from the shaman .
The foreign thoughts of nearby elnük , drüvasks , and horses flooded his consciousness with feelings that weren ’ t his own — a thunderous <unk> only he and the most powerful spirit walkers could hear , and could never truly quiet .
The emotions of men came next .
They were beasts as much as any other .
A thousand scattered thoughts : anger , fear , <unk> , cold — Udyr couldn ’ t hear himself screaming .
He simply became aware of the <unk> in his throat .
The voices wouldn ’ t go away ; they never went away .
He ripped through his bag searching for the silver nail .
The metal burned in his fingers as Udyr found it .
He plunged it into his palm again and again .
The shock of the metal <unk> the pain a <unk> — but to quiet the voices , he would give anything .
Anything .
Sejuani wondered how much of the army ’ s supplies she was risking in an attempt to contact the Ursine .
<unk> bonfires roared with flames three times the height of a man .
Around them stood Sejuani ’ s army , starving and cold , stared at the fires with exhaustion and uncertainty .
<unk> wood was a <unk> that <unk> life or death in this weather .
And there was no guarantee the Lost Ones would come .
The bonfires ’ <unk> had been arranged to match the <unk> <unk> of a death knot ’ s pattern .
<unk> on top of each other , the wood formed a series of burning <unk> .
<unk> the fires , tall , ancient <unk> were arranged .
<unk> with the Ursine ’ s symbols , around each stake was <unk> a pile of weapons and bones , like kindling .
All was ready .
The warriors preparing to channel the oath needed only the <unk> <unk> to begin the ritual .
She nodded to the bear spirit ’ s acolyte to begin .
He lifted the massive wooden bowl above Sejuani ’ s oathsingers and poured .
The bear ’ s blood covered them in sticky strings of gore , clinging to the men ’ s features and chests .
Each man then took the <unk> totem , dragged it across his chest , and snarled in pain as his skin was ripped open .
The final <unk> , a girl of only ten summers , shivered as the bear spirit ’ s acolyte <unk> the traditional <unk> of <unk> feathers around her neck like a collar .
Then she joined the choir of warriors around the main fire .
Her eyes rolled back as she released a <unk> noise from her throat , like wind crying in a storm .
Then the other oathsingers began .
Each overlapping , several <unk> at once , creating an unnatural , guttural dirge which <unk> with the fire ’ s roar .
The sound dug fear into Sejuani ’ s stomach like an <unk> hunger .
“ Get Udyr , ” she <unk> a pair of bloodsworn nearby .
<unk> by the fire , they nodded <unk> , <unk> even to look away from the ceremony .
“ Find our shaman ! ” she barked .
Her voice cut them from the trance , and her guards trudged into the darkness , outside of the firelight ’ s reach .
She marched from the fire to Bristle , her mount .
Sejuani knew , whatever uncertainty she felt , her people needed to feel she was ready to lead them into battle .
She climbed onto her saddle atop the giant mount ’ s back , an enormous , <unk> drüvask .
Its shoulders were twice as tall as her and <unk> than a dozen men .
When it snorted <unk> , she didn ’ t need the great shaman ’ s training to know what it felt .
Ice crackled around its claws as her unease resonated with her <unk> steed .
She was risking something other than her army ’ s supplies .
Above Sejuani , the fire ’ s embers floated toward the sky .
<unk> of flickering light danced upward and pointed to an approaching storm .
<unk> lightning flashed , briefly <unk> the wall of ferocious clouds boiling toward her .
In the face of this huge maelstrom , she felt as small as a child .
The first lighting bolt smashed into an iron stake with a crack .
Sejuani leaned forward in her saddle and ran her fingers through Bristle ’ s dark , <unk> fur .
To a horse , or some lesser mount , Sejuani would have lied and uttered <unk> words .
Instead she whispered , “ I don ’ t like it either .
But now everything <unk> on the great shaman … ” <unk> never came .
<unk> , black clouds <unk> the sun ’ s return .
Udyr shuddered in the cold .
The <unk> had frozen overnight .
The frost on his <unk> resisted his every move .
His mind twitched and wandered <unk> .
Too many creatures , too many men , surrounded him , and the clamor of their misery howled in his mind .
Sejuani had arranged her forces in the <unk> formation at the edge of the woods <unk> the <unk> .
The <unk> and <unk> warriors stood on the hill behind her <unk> <unk> .
<unk> the arrival of the Ursine tribe , everyone in her host had their weapons drawn and ready .
<unk> warriors smashed shields , <unk> sounded .
This was the way of the Freljord .
You <unk> yourself a friend before either side sheathed arms .
<unk> sparks of <unk> <unk> began crackling across the Winter ’ s Claw ’ s armor , swords , and axes .
Udyr watched as the tribe ’ s warriors <unk> to this alien thing , <unk> and jumping across their weapons .
He could feel their fear .
At the front of her army , Sejuani threw off her cloak with a <unk> .
No doubt to remind her tribe that their Warmother was a true Iceborn .
<unk> was the only warmth she needed ; ice magic was in her blood .
The army <unk> .
Udyr followed her to the edge of the forest .
The features of his face stretched , transformed .
<unk> formed , became <unk> then twisted back into an approximation of his own features .
Waves of hair formed and cascaded across his skin , covering him in fur before <unk> like waves in an <unk> , <unk> to some unknown tide .
He growled , <unk> , and <unk> .
Suddenly , Udyr ’ s eyes widened .
“ They ’ ve come . ” A silence swept over everything .
The first of the Ursine slipped out from between the black forest ’ s trees without a sound — <unk> , with their skin <unk> brown by blood .
Their hair matted with filth .
Some were naked ; others wore bear hides or the <unk> remains of clothes .
<unk> came the beasts , bears mostly , of <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
Some <unk> Udyr knew , others he ’ d never seen before .
They were spirit walkers trapped in the form of the unrelenting bear .
Men who had forgotten they were men .
Then came the monsters .
They were strange amalgamations of bears and other creatures , things of legends , dreams , and <unk> .
They had all been men once too , but now , so consumed by the true spirit , they had passed beyond what the normal animals looked like .
The <unk> of them , a huge <unk> thing , <unk> out of the forest — where its head should have been , a <unk> <unk> ’ s skull rested on a <unk> of black feathers .
<unk> glowing with blue fire , it opened its jaws to reveal a child ’ s face inside its maw .
Then the child opened its own mouth too , spewing a foul brown liquid .
Other nightmares followed it from the woods , limping , crawling , and <unk> forward .
The Ursine <unk> in a rough battle line across from Sejuani ’ s army .
They made no gesture to attack , spoke no words .
They simply waited .
Udyr ’ s ragged <unk> slowed , his nervous <unk> became a <unk> sway .
The pain in his hands <unk> .
He recognized a few of the souls across the field from him : <unk> , masters , and former oathsingers .
<unk> shamans he ’ d known in drink , warriors he ’ d known in battle .
<unk> of their consciousness remained .
Most had forgotten they were men .
Some had <unk> their souls into the raw , singular emotion of the unrelenting bear ’ s spirit , an unchecked confidence bordering on rage .
A man walked from between the trees , wearing only a great <unk> cowl and a <unk> cloak .
The Hounded Lord .
“ I am Ursine .
I come to bring the word of the Volibear , ” he announced .
Udyr remembered him from years before .
Back then he was Najak , a troubled boy and an <unk> spirit walker of great potential .
Udyr ’ s first <unk> , now reduced to the voice of the Ursine .
Even searching for it , pulling at the magic around him , Udyr could find little sound coming from Najak ’ s spirit or mind .
That boy was gone .
How deeply I failed you , Udyr thought , remembering too late that the Najak could hear his mind as clearly as shouted words .
“ <unk> is your true failure , ” the Hounded Lord snarled to answer Udyr ’ s thought .
“ You torture yourself by trying to control our gift .
<unk> its true power . ” The wind howled briefly through the <unk> trees behind him , sounding like ghostly <unk> .
“ Why have you called us , Winter ’ s Claw ? ” “ I ask for the strength of the Ursine . ” Sejuani intoned .
“ I ask you fight alongside my host , Hounded Lord . ” The young spirit walker turned his head from Udyr to Sejuani without moving his lifeless eyes .
“ You ask <unk> .
I am only the voice of the Volibear . ” “ As his <unk> , I would take your oath as — ” “ I cannot speak for him .
I am simply his instrument , ” The Hounded Lord interrupted her .
He seemed to stare through Sejuani .
“ Our lord <unk> with us . ” Udyr felt its power before it appeared .
The voices , the spirits in his mind from the men around him , which had endlessly <unk> him … began to soften .
Even that of Sejuani , standing beside him .
The ring of her <unk> impatience faded away .
The Volibear had come .
In the forest behind Najak , the great <unk> trees cracked and shook .
<unk> than a mammoth , it stepped out of the woods .
Walls of muscle , each limb <unk> than a man , <unk> the beast forward .
Its broken , ancient armor of dark , metal plates was <unk> brown by the dried gore of a hundreds of battles .
Broken weapons , rusted with age , <unk> from its back and shoulders .
One half of its face had been stripped of flesh , revealing oily bone , teeth , and horns .
From its mouth , an unnatural , black blood <unk> .
Its four eyes , <unk> ancient , alien , and <unk> , looked over Sejuani and Udyr .
As the bear spirit ’ s avatar came closer , it was like the quiet at the center of a storm .
Udyr ’ s focus became singular .
No sounds were left in his head .
No animals .
No feelings .
Even Udyr ’ s own thoughts barely whispered .
He felt only the Volibear .
Its silence felt nothing like a man or animal .
The Volibear ’ s consciousness crushed everything with its purity .
<unk> Sejuani ’ s army <unk> the Ursine by a hundred to one , her warriors backed away from the Volibear ’ s approach .
<unk> war <unk> , <unk> of numerous battles against men , trolls , and the <unk> vastaya , trembled in fear .
Sejuani gasped at the <unk> creature before her .
She had not considered the possibility that the avatar of the bear spirit would answer her summon personally .
Whatever value the Lost Ones offered , their master was worth a thousand times that .
She steeled herself in her saddle and held her ground against the Volibear ’ s slow <unk> .
Instead of fear , ambition flashed across her face .
Udyr fought against the silence , trying to speak , to remember the stories of his childhood .
Some said even the Volibear had been a man once .
A great shaman and spirit walker who ’ d surrendered himself to the bear spirit so completely that it was able to truly <unk> through him .
But looking at the scale of this monster , he doubted this thing could ever have been a man .
When the Volibear stopped in front of Sejuani , lightning crackled across its back .
The Volibear ’ s question flooded Udyr ’ s mind .
It overwhelmed him .
Udyr felt as if the words were bursting from inside his eyes , ripping through his fingertips .
“ What battle is worthy of us , <unk> ? ” The voice reverberated from every Ursine and spirit walker on the field .
Sejuani had watched as the Hounded Lord ’ s eyes rolled backwards , then darkened to black <unk> before his head tilted back .
Now the slight man spoke with a voice like an <unk> .
It was as if a <unk> had taken control of his throat and shaped itself into those words .
But what turned the Warmother in surprise was hearing Udyr whisper the same question .
<unk> quickly , Sejuani smiled , then answered with a voice both armies could hear .
“ I will burn the southern <unk> .
I will hunt their children for sport .
I will level their stone walls and houses so that none may stand against us again . ” She gestured southward .
“ All that snow <unk> will be ours .
My name will be fear , and our tribe will rule forever . ” For a moment , only the sound of Udyr ’ s cloak flapping in the wind followed her <unk> .
Above her , the black clouds circled like a tempest .
“ Ask for our strength , ” the voice said .
With every <unk> of his will , Udyr reached into his bag .
He pulled out his silver nail ; the cold heat of the metal numbed his arm .
If he could speak before Sejuani made the bargain … if he could make the human words come from his mouth … He had time … It wasn ’ t too late .
“ I ask for your strength , ” Sejuani replied , before her former mentor managed to force himself forward .
But shaking and <unk> , he then stumbled between her and the great bear spirit .
Udyr dug the silver nail into his hand — he felt nothing as it passed through .
No pain , not even the energy of the metal .
He opened his mouth to speak but found no words would come .
Instead , the Volibear ’ s consciousness shook him , forcing him to his knees .
“ <unk> do you offer as sacrifice ? ” Udyr and the Hounded Lord spoke with the spirit ’ s voice .
Udyr closed his eyes and pictured the Ionian hill , the red leaves falling around him .
That memory of learning meditation , learning to control his powers seemed so hollow now .
A faraway land he could never call home and would never see again .
Then , Udyr remembered his return to the Freljord , meeting young Sejuani , and the years of watching her grow into a Warmother under his <unk> .
From outside his body , Udyr heard his voice crack in effort .
“ She makes no pledge to you , bear spirit . ” He swallowed as he pushed himself toward the monstrous creature .
“ We offer only the war and its dead . ” The Volibear roared in anger .
The force of its howl pushed Udyr back toward Sejuani as the beast ’ s spell broke .
Sejuani had hunted <unk> alone .
She had tied her hair into a death knot before battle a dozen times in the past and , with those oaths , pledged victory or her own death .
She had charged into <unk> darkness and fought trolls blind .
But the moment the Volibear ’ s spell broke , when she looked up at the monstrous thing looming over her , she knew its true horror .
Its hair stood .
<unk> raged from within its flesh .
Its scars glowed .
<unk> poured from its mouth , as if it would <unk> .
And Sejuani felt the most <unk> fear she ’ d ever known ; she had almost pledged herself and her people to the Ursine .
This was the true power of the Volibear .
She looked to her former mentor in awe .
Somehow he ’ d found the strength to stand against this power .
“ Do you fear our war , spirit of the great bear !
? ” Udyr screamed at the monster .
The massive creature roared again , <unk> to become less and less like a bear — its flesh seemed to lift away : muscles , fur and flesh floated apart , connected only by the endless lighting crackling inside it .
The Volibear moved to attack .
Before it could strike , Sejuani rode straight at it , blocking its path to Udyr .
“ Will you fight alongside us , bear of storms and wilds ? ” Udyr shouted .
“ Or do you fear our war ? ” After a long moment , the monster answered .
“ We fear nothing . ” Udyr walked through the city ’ s ruined gates .
With what was left of the river city , there would be no warm <unk> to rid the cold from the night .
The structures around him had been reduced to black skeletons .
Only scorched timber and stone <unk> remained above the sharp <unk> of rubble .
As he headed to the center of the city , Udyr ’ s footsteps left a pale gray trail in the <unk> street .
Walls of black smoke swept around him , <unk> the streets and razed stone buildings .
When an inky cloud swept aside for a moment , it revealed a dozen Winter ’ s Claw warriors .
They ’ d formed a line around a burning guard <unk> , surrounding the few survivors and pushing them against the <unk> .
The remaining town guards desperately , <unk> clawed for an escape but they were met only with axes and death .
<unk> them , an Ursine butchered the remains of a <unk> .
It turned its <unk> face to look at Udyr .
<unk> covered its fur as it <unk> slammed a pair of axes into the man ’ s <unk> corpse .
Without stopping , the Ursine bellowed a roar , and the neighboring warriors closed in on the remaining guards , <unk> pushing them into the fire .
These were the first survivors Udyr had seen .
The Ursine had smashed through the city ’ s defenses first .
Sejuani ’ s forces followed , but they had matched the Lost Ones ’ savagery .
Even now , Udyr could feel the cruel , <unk> certainty of the bear spirit creeping through the thoughts of every creature around him .
The power of the Ursine was growing .
Udyr climbed up the rubble of a <unk> to a ruined square .
<unk> by tall stone buildings , he found the monster waiting for him .
<unk> and in the middle of the city , the bear spirit ’ s avatar impaled corpses on stakes arranged in some <unk> pattern .
Black branches and roots grew from the speared bodies around the beast , like <unk> slowly crawling from the earth .
The flesh and fur on the Volibear ’ s face had <unk> , its muscles seemed <unk> , stronger than before .
The Volibear ’ s eyes turned to Udyr as the shaman approached .
Across its face , a dozen new eyes bloomed , each as dark and cold as a spider ’ s .
Perhaps it smelled the foreign magic on the Winter ’ s Claw shaman , and now deemed him worthy of <unk> .
Somehow Udyr knew , this time , it spoke to him alone .
“ I will be reborn .
You cannot stop that , son of man , ” the beast said .
Udyr removed his cloak .
Then , prepared by his evening meditation , he walked through his forms : the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the Iron <unk> , and a dozen more spirit beasts .
He paused when he assumed the aspect of the bear spirit .
With perfect control , he matched the shape of the giant beast looming above him .
Then , finally , Udyr changed from the bear into its sworn enemy , the spirit of fire , hearth , and forge — the Great <unk> .
Udyr wasn ’ t afraid of the fight he would <unk> have with this creature .
He wasn ’ t afraid of anything .
His head was clear .
And in this certainty … he knew those were bad signs .
The Volibear would consume him as <unk> as Sejuani .
But his resolve did not <unk> .
He had sworn an oath to protect Sejuani , as a father would .
No matter the cost .
“ You will not take her , ” Udyr spat .
Silence was the only answer the beast gave as it turned back to its gruesome task .
= = = = = = A <unk> <unk> THE VOICES = = = = = = = = MICHAEL LUO = = Far above , Udyr heard the cries of an eagle riding the gale .
Its voice was strong , confident , but not close enough to get in the way of his own thoughts .
It was a relief to feel this human .
The voices were never silent , but Udyr knew not to be <unk> .
Even a moment ’ s <unk> was rare .
I can hear myself breathe … for now , at least .
Today , he walked alone .
He <unk> up the mountain slopes , a chill wind following him , carrying away his lingering memory of Ionia ’ s ethereal beauty with every gust .
The monks at Hirana had offered him a parting gift a few moons past when he left their lands — a riddle intended to guide him on his path to <unk> his <unk> powers .
Below winter ’ s peak <unk> ’ s pure life essence flows Now transformed to glass It read more <unk> in their tongue than his own , but it had not taken him long to solve .
After <unk> months traveling with the blind <unk> , Udyr had learned to <unk> the meaning behind Ionian speech .
Reaching the <unk> eastern slopes of <unk> , Udyr paused to gaze out at the lake before him , frozen in all its majesty .
At the edges of the lake laid the bones and corpses of wild beasts , as well as those of dead shamans and priests who had come to this place , months , years , and lifetimes before him .
Udyr stood still , his chest bare , eyes closed , bracing against the <unk> morning air .
This land was my home … He looked down at his reflection on the ice .
It showed the face of a man , ragged and worn from his <unk> .
My rest ends .
I hear them coming .
The ice stirred .
A crack at first , as Udyr saw his image splinter into <unk> pieces .
Soon , entire slabs broke off , drifting apart .
Udyr waited , respectfully .
The frigid water bubbled .
Slowly to begin with , and then rapidly all at once .
<unk> rose from the surface , filling the air with heat .
Udyr took in a quiet breath , his shoulders rising , to ready himself .
Out of the mist leapt an <unk> beast , carved by the land ’ s magic and <unk> from the lake .
The ground trembled as it took a thundering step toward Udyr .
Udyr looked up at the wild spirit towering above him , three times his height .
The murmurs started low , soft — leaves falling on fresh snow .
Yet quickly , they grew .
<unk> .
<unk> .
There they are .
<unk> turned into <unk> , mutters into <unk> , one swallowing another .
Their rage seized his mind , shattering his every thought .
At first , the voices <unk> for <unk> — <unk> , drüvasks , and others .
Udyr had heard these voices within himself many times .
Soon , they joined together , into the shape he had most feared .
The ravenous tiger .
“ Spirit walker .
Step closer , ” it growled .
“ <unk> your voice and show us why you have returned . ” Udyr only just mustered the strength to stifle a gasp .
His knees buckled under the weight of the noise in his head .
His hands shot toward the soil to steady his body .
<unk> his neck , he glared up at the savage creature , not willing to answer .
The voices rose at the sight of Udyr ’ s inaction , with the tiger roaring above the rest .
“ You do not deserve to call the Freljord home .
You are weak . ” Udyr braced himself as the spirit rammed its head into him , shards of its icy body cutting into his skin .
<unk> far across the ground , Udyr landed against hard rock .
I must not give in .
<unk> his balance , he wiped the blood off his face and forced his hands into fists .
He punched his knuckles into the frosty ground , and the throbbing in his arms overtook him .
Veins pulsated from his hands to his shoulders .
Getting back to his feet , Udyr readied himself to <unk> another blow .
The spirit roared once more .
“ The strong fight !
Instead , you stifle your voice and <unk> ! ” The spirit charged headfirst .
Udyr tried <unk> out of the way , but his foe was quicker and stronger .
As he rolled to the side , the tiger <unk> his leg with its claws , <unk> the spirit walker ’ s blood across the frosted ground .
Udyr knelt on one knee in pain .
He felt his own anger building , but still he held back .
I must not give in .
The spirit loomed closer , letting out a feral cry before pouncing toward Udyr .
<unk> he could not <unk> in time , he crossed his arms before him and clenched his fists .
<unk> energy surrounded him , blocking the tiger spirit ’ s lethal blow .
The spirit slid backward .
After <unk> its footing , it grinned through its fangs .
Its icy body crackled with <unk> energy , splintering the bones of its past victims beneath its feet .
Death was all this place knew .
Udyr knelt on both knees now , his head down , his body pounding with pain while the spirit paced around him .
He felt the ground shake with its every step .
This is not the way .
He gritted his teeth , their points drawing blood from his lips as he felt the ground tremble once more .
The voices boomed .
“ The weak … are prey ! ” Udyr looked up , seeing the spirit charge toward him , its eyes <unk> for blood — so wide he could see himself staring back , with the same lust for violence .
I must embrace who I am .
Golden flames erupted from Udyr ’ s skin like <unk> , the anger coursing through his body <unk> the fury of the tiger spirit before him .
“ Finally , the prey has <unk> to fight ! ” Udyr roared as he rushed straight at the tiger spirit .
<unk> onto the beast ’ s leg , he climbed its <unk> surface , smashing his <unk> hands into whatever piece of ice he could to pull himself upward .
The creature shook , the sharp edges of its body piercing the spirit walker ’ s skin .
Udyr screamed , <unk> in his might .
At last , his wrath matched the fire in his foe , as the two reveled in their savage violence .
With a brutal <unk> , he reached the spirit ’ s back , trails of his blood dripping down its sides .
Spirit energy surged through him , a force strong enough to drown out any pain .
The voices of wild beasts <unk> unchecked in his mind — the bitter cries of those consumed by the tiger , and his own <unk> anger — <unk> as one .
“ I am no prey ! ” Udyr brought his fists down in a <unk> of explosive blows , creating a web of cracks running down the creature ’ s body .
He clawed and slashed with abandon , tearing away at his foe .
<unk> in pure rage , he threw back his head and sank his fangs deep into the spirit ’ s neck .
He expected the spirit to tumble over , its body to break apart , giant lumps of ice <unk> to dust .
But it was already gone , along with its voices .
Had they shrieked ?
Had they cried ?
<unk> above , he heard the eagle call .
<unk> .
<unk> .
Udyr fell and staggered onto solid ground .
Breathing heavily , he lay next to the lake , and watched the last of his enemy vanish .
Suddenly , he heard another rumbling and stumbled to his feet .
The lake , as if celebrating his victory , began to <unk> .
<unk> by piece , the remaining ice melted , raising the water level to wash over the cold , hard land .
<unk> the ritual he had repeated countless times at Hirana , Udyr limped forth .
<unk> his hands , he splashed cool water across his head , shoulders , and back , <unk> his wounds clean .
Then , gently , he took a drink .
He stared at his reflection , seeing a man looking back .
<unk> , <unk> , alive .
I am who I am .
Udyr heard only the sound of flowing water — and yet , he did not smile .
But this fight is far from over .
= = = = = = <unk> OF THE <unk> <unk> = = = = = = = = <unk> <unk> <unk> = = “ I don ’ t understand , ” General Granth mutters , <unk> trying to <unk> the light from his <unk> .
“ There ’ s nothing here .
It ’ s a dead end . ” He stands at the threshold , framed by the dark stonework against the deeper darkness beyond it .
He does not see the open <unk> before him , nor the angular <unk> inscriptions that surround it .
He does not see the fragments of bone that <unk> the flagstones beneath his boots .
I smile , playing my part .
“ It is the <unk> of things , ” I tell him , “ to hide in plain sight . ” The <unk> turns , confusion and frustration written clearly upon his face .
“ Don ’ t play games with me , cousin !
Do you have any idea what I ’ m risking , being down here ?
Or what would happen if we ’ re caught ?
These <unk> are forbidden , by order of the <unk> — there are Legion <unk> everywhere ! ” This , at least , is true .
Ever since the usurper Swain seized control , he has kept the Immortal Bastion locked down .
<unk> , it is to protect the <unk> against <unk> from those noble houses that <unk> its creation .
<unk> , he is daring men like Brannin Granth to <unk> themselves as his enemies .
“ But they would not doubt your <unk> , ” I reassure him .
“ A hero of the Gates of Mourning , no less .
You are to be honored by command of the Grand General himself .
What can they say to that ?
If we were spotted , you would not even need to run . ” His expression <unk> .
“ Oh , you don ’ t run from the <unk> Legion … ” I do not need to hear this <unk> veiled <unk> again .
In little more than a year , Swain has built a certain <unk> around himself and the Hand of Noxus , and those that serve them both .
It is a brilliant <unk> , though it fills my heart with hatred to admit it .
Even so , I let Granth have his moment .
It is why we are here .
His eyes fall to the ground .
“ We didn ’ t win the Gates of Mourning — the Legion did .
That ’ s why Swain won ’ t <unk> the triumph .
He knows we need not even have been there , damn him .
He insults us with this pomp and ceremony , in front of all Noxus ! ” I nod , <unk> a hand on Granth ’ s shoulder .
“ And that is why we will make him pay for everything he has done .
You are a true Noxian , anyone can see that .
I have told the others all about you , and they wish to meet you for themselves .
She wishes to meet you . ” “ I can ’ t meet anyone , cousin , if we can ’ t get inside . ” He glances around .
“ <unk> ’ t the Black <unk> — ” I recoil .
“ Do not use that name .
It makes you sound like … well , as you said .
Like you don ’ t understand . ” Pushing past him , I stride through the <unk> mouth of the gate .
He almost drops the lantern in surprise , seeing the entrance now , for the first time .
<unk> after me , Granth <unk> to make sure we are not being followed , then <unk> into the shadows of the <unk> .
“ Is it true ? ” he <unk> .
“ What they say about her , is it true ? ” I do not slow my pace .
“ Come .
Find out for yourself . ” The Immortal Bastion is not a <unk> , as most <unk> believe .
<unk> is it merely a fortress , in the sense that the old tribes knew it .
The stone around us almost <unk> with power , though Granth is mostly oblivious .
I have seen it countless times , through the centuries — he knows something is not right , but feels it only as a <unk> drag on his limbs , and a whispering itch in the back of his brain .
Few mortals last long when they are this close to the source .
To his <unk> , he still has his wits about him , enough to reach for his dagger when a robed figure <unk> from the gloom .
… I pass both of us , coming in the other direction .
I look tired .
No matter .
This will be concluded soon enough .
Granth eyes me suspiciously until I disappear from sight , then <unk> to the side of the person he knows as his cousin .
“ Hadrion , who are these people ? ” Granth asks , as more <unk> figures come and go .
“ I don ’ t recognize any of them .
Are they the allies you spoke of , among the other houses ? ” I sigh .
It is <unk> that the <unk> <unk> minds often cannot see what is right in front of them .
“ They are <unk> to our family ’ s <unk> , ” I reply , keeping the <unk> from my voice .
“ We , all of us , are committed to the <unk> of the usurper , and the <unk> of the throne .
It is better that you do not know their names , or their faces . ” He <unk> .
“ But how can we work together , if we — ” The words die on his lips as we turn the last corner .
We stand at the edge of the great well of souls , <unk> down into the <unk> of Noxus , far deeper than the physical <unk> of the Bastion should even allow .
A roiling <unk> of cold blues and jealous greens <unk> in the distance beneath us , <unk> the three bridges that span the gap .
There , between them , suspended against the madness , is a <unk> , hulking silhouette that every Noxian knows only too well .
A husk of lifeless armor <unk> in every history book , and a thousand <unk> <unk> scattered across the old city .
Granth takes half a step back .
“ It can &apos;t be … ” he murmurs .
“ It … It can &apos;t … ” His voice is cracking .
His eyes <unk> with tears .
I lean in over his shoulder , to whisper behind his ear .
“ Do you see the truth of it , now ?
The truth behind the great empire of Noxus ?
So has it been for centuries , since the days of the first kings — no Grand General , no <unk> or tyrant , can stand unless the mistress of the Immortal Bastion allows it .
Many are those who would serve , though few prove worthy . ” I gently pluck the lantern from his trembling fingers , and guide him away from the sight that has so transfixed him , toward the veiled <unk> that line the passage on either side .
“ Swain must fall .
Our cabal is utterly committed to this , above all else , and we will sacrifice whatever we must to achieve it . ” On some level , Granth knows what he will see even before I pull back the shroud .
It is the <unk> body of his cousin , Hadrion .
The younger man ’ s features are frozen in a deathly rictus , yet there is an unmistakable sense of peace about it .
“ Your house was <unk> out most <unk> during the <unk> , Brannin Granth .
Your father and his brothers were stripped of all they possessed , simply for remaining true to <unk> Darkwill at the end .
Hadrion gave his life gladly in pursuit of revenge .
Will you honor that <unk> , and join us now , too ? ” Granth sinks to his knees , looking up at me with fresh eyes .
“ You .
You are her .
You are the pale woman . ” He does not even <unk> when a second pale woman appears at my side .
We speak with the same voice .
“ I am everywhere .
I am everyone .
You know only what you need to know , and see what I want you to see . ” <unk> Swain is not the only one who can <unk> his own legend .
A third pale woman steps out behind Granth , and then a <unk> .
Even so , he bows his head to me , no doubt convinced he finally <unk> .
He does not need us to point out the empty <unk> beside his cousin ’ s .
“ With all my heart , ” he <unk> , “ and every drop of my noble blood , I will serve you , my lady .
I will not rest until the pretender Swain is dead . ” This <unk> fool thinks he will be the one to land the killing blow .
I will let him think that , for it <unk> my purpose , which is merely to <unk> the Grand General ’ s defenses .
I <unk> the <unk> of the cabal in the air above Granth ’ s head , marking him as my own .
None who can see it will interfere with the plots we shall soon <unk> .
“ Rise then , proud son of the <unk> .
Your pledge is heard and accepted .
Together , we will be <unk> , and your name will be <unk> as the savior of an empire . ” = = = = = = THE <unk> <unk> <unk> = = = = = = = = MICHAEL LUO = = <unk> the setting sun , hidden behind a dense thicket , a young lady stands with large black bows in her <unk> blue hair , <unk> by golden <unk> and an <unk> tailored dress .
Her hands grip a pair of giant spectral scissors .
It has been weeks — months , maybe — since she first arrived on the western continent .
The land here <unk> a vast horizon , the biggest she has ever seen , but Gwen has one thing on her mind : The Black Mist .
She has tracked it here all the way from the Isles , stopping it wherever she could .
Not far off in the distance sits a small cobblestone <unk> .
A <unk> <unk> out smoke .
<unk> windows begin to glow with the reflection of candlelight .
A wooden door swings open and two boys run out , each holding a doll .
They chase one another across the <unk> , laughing and shouting words of battle .
In this moment , they are no longer children and their toys no longer cloth and string .
They are kings and their toys are brave warriors , fighting evil to defend their kingdoms .
Gwen <unk> .
She thinks of her maker ’ s home , not too different from the one before her now .
She remembers how it felt to play without a worry in the world .
Back when she was a toy doll herself , back when her maker was happy and safe ...
The pain always <unk> first .
Gwen <unk> her chest , and then she sees it .
From the woods to the east , it comes : thin tendrils of blackened mist , <unk> over each other to form almost familiar shapes .
Their contorted hands claw for life under the weight of piercing screams .
The boys drop their toys and run .
Gwen cannot bear to hear their cries .
Not those of the Black Mist — that she has heard many times — but of the children .
They are innocent .
They deserve joy .
She leaps out of the thicket .
Her scissors swing high above her head , white wisps flowing from their closed blades .
As her dress <unk> , she slashes in a downward arc , ripping a slew of <unk> Black Mist wraiths asunder .
“ Ha ! ” Gwen shouts .
“ Took you quite long enough .
<unk> of me , are you ? ” The wraiths turn their attention to Gwen and <unk> through jagged <unk> .
Gwen looks to the stunned children , crouched behind a fallen tree .
Her voice <unk> .
“ Don ’ t worry .
I won ’ t let them hurt you . ” The wraiths <unk> .
<unk> cries fill the air .
Dark , <unk> clouds <unk> out of the once gentle sky , surrounding Gwen .
The boys <unk> close .
Gwen opens her scissors .
For a breath , the wraiths stand still .
Gwen <unk> her chance and <unk> forward .
She cuts too fast for the naked eye .
<unk> of darkness appear and fade , sheared out of existence by Gwen ’ s magical blades .
One , two , three seconds later , and only a small handful of the Black Mist ’ s <unk> remain .
Gwen <unk> her breath , one hand on her knee , the other holding her scissors <unk> in the dirt .
<unk> threads of her dress sway in the wind .
Her eyes <unk> for the collapsed tree .
Two pairs of frightened eyes <unk> out .
She turns her attention back to the wraiths .
“ I won ’ t let them down , ” she says to herself .
“ I promised I wouldn ’ t let anyone down . ” She <unk> a few needles out of her pocket and <unk> them upward .
With a spin , she <unk> a hand down on the ground .
The needles , as if on command , fall into place and form a circle around Gwen .
She <unk> her eyes and whispers , “ <unk> be my mist . ” <unk> of mist , white with <unk> of light , flow from each needle .
One boy <unk> his eyes .
The other looks on .
This mist is different .
It feels quiet , warm , safe even ?
Its threads swirl and blend <unk> , the work of a master seamstress .
Soon , Gwen is shrouded by a protective fog .
A single wraith , brave or desperate , <unk> into this <unk> domain .
The others <unk> nearby , eager to follow .
Inside , Gwen <unk> <unk> around her foe .
She <unk> every claw , every <unk> , <unk> between the <unk> of her scissors .
Another wraith <unk> .
Another chuckle echoes .
From the outside , both boys watch in awe .
Who is she ?
What is she ?
To them , it appears easy , but Gwen knows these wraiths are <unk> .
She needs to end this .
<unk> her teeth , she swings her scissors , slicing another wraith in two before setting her weapon aside .
She draws her last needles and , channeling all the magic she can muster , <unk> them forward .
They fly from the shroud into the hollow chests of the wraiths .
Gwen does not chuckle .
She lets out a <unk> yell as the wraiths burst and vanish , leaving only needles on the dirt .
A cool breeze <unk> Gwen ’ s glistening brow as all the mist <unk> .
She grabs her scissors and needles , and <unk> .
Her eyes turn back to the fallen tree where the children now sit .
Gwen approaches them .
“ Are you alright ? ” A <unk> face looks at her and nods .
“ You ’ re <unk> ! ” the other boy <unk> .
He drops his torn doll to the ground where another already lies .
“ Not like us , ” he mutters under his breath .
“ We can ’ t do nothin ’ . ” Gwen <unk> .
She senses their pain .
They were helpless , and they have every right to be <unk> and angry , yet she can ’ t help but see the broken dolls and feel hurt herself .
“ Who are — ” one boy begins .
“ Will you stay with us ? ” the other <unk> out .
Gwen wonders for a second before a <unk> woman , short of breath , rushes out and <unk> the children .
“ My <unk> !
I ’ m so glad you ’ re safe , ” she says , tears flowing down her face .
“ <unk> me , miss , ” Gwen says <unk> .
“ Who are you ? ” “ Oh , you ’ ll have to forgive me , ” the woman replies .
“ Where are my manners ? ” She <unk> her eyes , sees Gwen in full for the first time , and <unk> .
“ She ’ s our <unk> , <unk> ! ” a child says .
The woman nods and <unk> her son .
“ Thank you , ” the woman says to Gwen , her voice <unk> .
“ I don &apos;t know what those things were , or who you are , for that matter ... but you saved my boys , and that ’ s enough for me . ” Her hands reach toward Gwen , palms open — a sign of gratitude .
Gwen looks at the mother ’ s hands , the calluses on her fingers and the <unk> in her nails .
She sees her <unk> , its front pocket holding a <unk> <unk> with thread trailing toward the cobblestone house .
Gwen eyes the broken dolls again and smiles <unk> .
Watching the mother ’ s arms wrapped around her children , she hears laughter .
Its sweet tones of <unk> and relief remind Gwen of something stronger than the children ’ s pain .
Love .
And not just a pure , innocent kind , but one born out of sacrifice .
Gwen steals a <unk> at the distant horizon , remembering her maker .
She <unk> her scissors down and picks up the children ’ s dolls , setting them in their mother ’ s hands .
“ Oh , these silly toys I made for them , ” the woman says .
“ Why , I was once a silly toy , just like these , ” Gwen says .
“ But I was brought to life by magic . ” “ Magic !
What magic ? ” a boy asks .
“ Well , I ’ m not entirely sure , ” Gwen thinks aloud , “ but the person who had that magic was my maker , you see , and the sacrifices she made came from a very special place .
A <unk> , loving place . ” Gwen turns to the woman .
“ Your mother might know . ” The woman and her children stare at Gwen , confused .
“ I ’ m sorry , ” Gwen says to them , knowing the Black Mist is still out there .
“ I must get going . ” She grabs her scissors with one hand and <unk> out two threads with the other .
They <unk> in the air , two precious <unk> , before finding homes in the dolls ’ torn fabric , <unk> their rips together .
“ <unk> ! ” one boy says , lifting his mended toy up high .
His brother <unk> Gwen ’ s <unk> motion at his own doll , hoping it ’ ll somehow <unk> on its own .
“ I wish I had magic , ” he says , eyes wide .
Gwen looks at the mother , whose love is reflected in how tight she holds her children , and sees the brothers ’ joy , listening to their renewed laughter as they play with their dolls .
“ You do , ” Gwen whispers before turning to leave the family behind .
= = = = = = NO <unk> <unk> = = = = = = = = UNKNOWN = = <unk> waves crashed on the bleak shore , red with the blood of the men Hecarim had already butchered .
The mortals he had yet to kill were retreating over the beach in terror .
Black rain <unk> them and <unk> boiled in from the mourning heart of the island .
He heard them shouting to one another .
The words were a guttural <unk> he did not recognize , but the meaning was clear ; they actually thought they might live to reach their ship .
True , they had some skill .
They moved as one , wooden shields <unk> .
But they were mortal and Hecarim savored the <unk> of their fear .
He circled them , threading crumbling ruins and unseen in the shadowed mist rising from the ashen sand .
The echoing thunder of his hooves struck sparks from black rocks .
It gnawed at their courage .
He watched the mortals through the <unk> visor of his helm .
The weak light of their wretched spirits was flickering corposant in their flesh .
It <unk> him even as he <unk> it .
“ <unk> lives , ” he said .
His voice was muffled by the dread iron of his helm , like the <unk> of a hanged man .
The sound scraped along their nerves like rusted blades .
He drank in their terror and grinned as one man threw down his shield and ran for the ship in desperation .
He bellowed as he galloped from the <unk> ruins , lowering his hooked glaive and feeling the old thrill of the charge .
A memory flickered , riding at the head of a silver host .
<unk> glory and honor .
The memory faded as the man reached the dark surf of cold <unk> and looked over his shoulder .
“ Please !
No ! ” he cried .
Hecarim split him from collarbone to <unk> in one thunderous blow .
His <unk> glaive pulsed as it bathed in blood .
The fragile wisp of the man ’ s spirit sought to fly free , but the mist ’ s hunger would not be <unk> .
Hecarim watched as the soul was twisted into a dark reflection of the man ’ s life .
Hecarim drew the power of the island to him and the bloody surf <unk> with motion as a host of dark knights wreathed in shimmering light rose from the water .
<unk> within archaic plates of ghostly iron , they drew black swords that <unk> with dark radiance .
He should know these men .
They had served him once and served him still , but he had no memory of them .
He turned back towards the mortals on the beach .
He parted the <unk> , <unk> in their terror as they saw him clearly for the first time .
His colossal form was a nightmarish <unk> of man and horse , a <unk> <unk> of <unk> iron .
The plates of his body were dark and <unk> with <unk> whose <unk> he only <unk> recalled .
<unk> <unk> behind his visor , the spirit within cold and dead yet <unk> vital .
Hecarim reared as <unk> <unk> of lightning split the sky .
He lowered his glaive and led his knights in the charge , throwing up giant <unk> of <unk> sand and bone fragments as he went .
The mortals screamed and brought up their shields , but the <unk> charge was unstoppable .
Hecarim struck first as was his right as their master , and the thunderous impact splintered the <unk> wide open .
Men were <unk> to bloody <unk> beneath his <unk> bulk .
His glaive struck out left and right , killing with every strike .
The ghost knights crushed all before them , slaughtering the living in a fury of thrashing hooves , stabbing lances and <unk> blades .
<unk> cracked and blood sprayed as mortal spirits fled broken bodies , already trapped between life and death by the fell magic of the Ruined King .
The spirits of the dead circled Hecarim , <unk> to him as their killer and he revelled in the <unk> joy of battle .
He ignored the wailing spirits .
He had no interest in <unk> them .
Leave such petty <unk> to the Chain Warden .
All Hecarim cared for was killing .
= = = = = = THE <unk> OF <unk> = = = = = = = = MICHAEL <unk> <unk> = = The fog had come in swiftly , <unk> the afternoon sun over the crossroads .
Jonath had tried to find his way between the thick tendrils , the world around him darkened by an <unk> shroud .
Shapes pushed at the fabric of the mist , grasping for purchase .
Reaching for him from beyond .
He <unk> with the reins in his hands , trying to find the <unk> to do what he had to .
So he could mount up and ride for safety .
“ Don ’ t do this , boy .
We all have a duty . ” Jonath blinked the fear from his eyes , <unk> on the knight slumped over the steed .
He had found her like this , still mounted but unable to even right herself in the saddle .
Her armor was pierced and slick with blood , although Jonath didn ’ t know what <unk> of weapon could have inflicted these wounds .
The knight was dying all the same .
In her eyes , he saw judgment — they found him weak .
<unk> .
She gripped the reins firmly in one plated fist , pulling him in close .
“ We must carry word to the capital .
You ... the heir must know .
Tell <unk> Jarvan what is happening here , the garrison cannot hold them off . ” <unk> sounds of battle from the south told Jonath that the beings in the mist had reached Havenfall .
The air around him grew colder , darker .
The inky mist pulsated , <unk> close .
Havenfall ’ s knights were none of his business .
The supposed elite of the crown had never done anything for him .
And the people there ... <unk> shut his eyes , Jonath ripped the reins from the knight , trying to ignore her <unk> gasp as she rolled out of the saddle and hit the ground .
“ Protector forgive me , ” he whispered , his voice wavering .
This was no worse than the other times he ’ d taken horses , he tried to tell himself as he mounted .
The war steed ’ s bulk <unk> a measure of calm in him .
Running a hand down the stallion ’ s <unk> neck , Jonath looked around the crossroads to get his <unk> .
The <unk> road led to the Great City , with its high walls and countless soldiers .
What warning did they need ?
Surely , whatever foul magic urged the claws and voices in the mist would be no match for the capital ’ s <unk> of stone and steel .
Just to the south lay Havenfall , his home .
Moments ago , he could see its glinting rooftops and rows of masts from where he now stood .
Behind the town lay open country , as far as a horse could carry him .
Jonath had spent days beyond count riding across those rolling hills , racing incoming ships along the white cliffs overlooking the bay , letting the sea <unk> his hair with salt , <unk> in the <unk> of unchecked freedom .
He ’ d never kept any he took .
He was no thief who deserved to be <unk> to the <unk> .
He borrowed horses , always returning them at the end of his <unk> , tired but unharmed .
How will I return this one ?
If I leave her to — No .
It wasn ’ t his fault she had gotten in the way of this mist and <unk> her chance at survival — for Jonath to take his did not make him guilty of her death .
No matter what he did , he had always been deemed <unk> .
He had a hand with horses and the will to work , but even his elders — horse <unk> and traders — had <unk> him for his <unk> to put the demands of others ahead of his own needs .
No use in talent if he couldn ’ t be relied on , they said .
No use in the approval of people who didn ’ t value true freedom , thought Jonath .
Not to mention the garrison , who <unk> obedience above all else , <unk> at him down <unk> lances even when he came to prove his <unk> on the <unk> fields .
Well , out in the hills , chasing the wind on the back of an unbroken steed , he was the <unk> .
He would <unk> this unnatural mist , and lose himself among the ranging <unk> .
Jonath spurred the stallion , making for the southern path , as time slowed down around him .
The stallion flattened his ears , suddenly rigid under Jonath .
Whatever had scared it was beyond the natural din of battle , something that didn ’ t belong here ; Jonath felt it , too .
<unk> fear seized him , <unk> his chest with an unyielding grip .
The mist pulled close , then pulsed clear of the crossing , as if limbs within were pulling the veil aside .
Jonath heard nothing in the deathly stillness .
Then came the sound of steeled hooves on <unk> road .
As the veil parted , Jonath made out riders in the gloom .
Even though he could hear the <unk> at full gallop , the clatter of plate armor , and the whipping of <unk> , the echelon appeared <unk> — like a framed tableau of nobles on the hunt , or the crown ’ s elite on the charge , come at the last second to defend the <unk> against the dangers beyond the border .
But these were not Demacian knights , nor <unk> from <unk> tales .
These riders were not here to protect .
They were <unk> in black-iron plate , and an evil light glowed in their motionless eyes .
A <unk> carried a still <unk> , the beating fabric audible nonetheless .
A <unk> , <unk> mouth <unk> around his instrument , sounded the attack .
The mist shrieked .
<unk> .
It was a name — somehow , Jonath knew .
The mist heralded his coming .
It was the name of death itself .
As this realization staggered Jonath , he noticed the rider at the lead .
He was gigantic , towering over his <unk> , shaking the ground with each unmoving stride .
His eyes , bright with inner fire , took in all before them .
Even staring ahead , they seemed to bore into Jonath , searing through him , filling him with an ancient dread .
The rider turned his head , and smiled .
Jonath let out a cry , <unk> with <unk> fear .
He flailed , kicking back to stay in the saddle , <unk> his stallion .
The mount reared , throwing Jonath to the ground with a dry thud .
<unk> by the shock , the animal bolted into the darkness .
Jonath <unk> , his head ringing with the impact .
He pressed his forehead against the dry earth , dust <unk> his <unk> with each panicked breath .
He wished he could pray away what he would see when he looked up .
“ Rise , squire , ” a grinding voice said , a smile pulling the syllables taut .
“ Find your courage ... Look at me . ” The words were guttural , each <unk> slowly <unk> as if rising from the depths of a furnace .
Jonath could not place the accent , but he had heard its mocking tone before .
A sting of old spite made him raise his head .
<unk> <unk> hooves burned the soil where they stood .
The rider ’ s horse seemed to be made entirely of blackened iron , glowing from within with green fire .
Jonath ’ s breath caught in his throat as he saw the rider was not saddled on this unnatural steed — he was fused with it .
What was he ?
Had he come as punishment for Jonath ’ s crime ?
The monstrosity laughed , slowly raising an infernal glaive .
Tears ran down Jonath ’ s face , his mind <unk> hold of the only thought it could .
Protector forgive me .
Protector forgive me .
But the blow never fell .
Instead , the monster called one of his ghostly riders closer .
The rider , too , was not a horseman at all , but fused at the <unk> with the body of a horse .
The entire echelon was <unk> like their leader .
Hecarim gripped the rider ’ s neck and slowly , effortlessly , ripped his torso from the <unk> trunk .
The rider , trailing green smoke , made no sound , <unk> <unk> .
Where his body had been , there was now the head of a withered , armored destrier .
“ We ’ ll be back for you later , ” the leader chuckled as he released the rider ’ s spirit .
The spirit floated mid-air , <unk> now that it had been severed from its animal half .
The rest of the undying echelon remained utterly motionless , frozen in time .
Hecarim turned his gaze to Jonath .
“ I claim this land by decree of King Viego , <unk> of the Shadow Isles .
Let my loyal knights witness that Hecarim , <unk> of <unk> , Grand Master of the Iron Order , <unk> his <unk> with a fair fight . ” The words twisted around his smirk .
“ So , find your courage , noble squire , and mount up .
War has come . ” He <unk> the reins of the spectral destrier to Jonath .
Jonath took in Hecarim , the tone of his offer betraying it for the lie it was .
He looked around him , the echelon of knights looming , <unk> rictus grins carved into their <unk> faces .
His mind screamed in tune with the whispers behind the veil .
Let soldiers deal with these monsters .
He grabbed the reins and , with one motion , swung up into the saddle .
The steed ’ s body was solid yet <unk> at the same time , the heavy <unk> hissing where it moved against the beast ’ s bulk .
Where he would sense a horse ’ s character , Jonath felt only emptiness .
Where he should feel a union of kindred minds , he <unk> on the edge of a ravenous <unk> .
Jonath let his fear take over and hammered his heels into its flanks .
He ripped at the reins and turned south , piercing into the wall of black mist ... <unk> nails <unk> my skin .
<unk> <unk> accusing me .
... and bursting out the other side into the clear .
Ahead , the path was open .
The sun was setting over the bay , the sea glittering calmly beyond the cliffs .
Behind Jonath , hollow , furnace laughter echoed through the crossroads .
“ Give chase , ” he heard Hecarim order .
Jonath clung to the steed , <unk> down the path faster than he had ever seen any stallion gallop .
In his wake , a thin trail of the unnatural mist <unk> the packed earth .
The sun was setting into the bay , giving way to the deep blue of <unk> .
It had been a beautiful day for a ride ; if he kept its pace , he might see another .
<unk> up , he saw the Protector ’ s <unk> coming into view in the darkening sky .
Jonath ’ s smile at the <unk> turned stale as he heard the long call of a hunting horn .
His heartbeat quickened as he saw thick tendrils of mist closing in behind him .
The monstrous Hecarim and his Iron Order rode within .
Tendrils of darkness flanked Jonath , and he thought he could see shapes coalescing inside .
His mouth fell open in horror , his vision <unk> from sudden tears .
He could see her nonetheless .
The knight he had left to die , now a ghostly form trapped in the mist .
She raised an arm that ended in a ragged <unk> — the hand that had held the reins , missing .
“ You have no honor , ” she wailed .
“ You are no true Demacian ! ” “ Please , no , ” Jonath whispered , forcing his gaze ahead .
He frantically kicked the steed ’ s flanks , willing it to get him away from this horror .
He glanced down at the reins .
The knight ’ s severed fist was <unk> them , yanking the mount into a <unk> .
“ <unk> , coward , ” the voice echoed from the mist .
<unk> in anguish , Jonath ripped the reins out of the fist and threw the plated gauntlet toward the riders at his heels .
“ So quick to take <unk> , squire , ” Hecarim <unk> .
“ I did not think you had the courage .
If you are <unk> me to a duel , then I accept .
We <unk> have a <unk> to follow , after all . ” Jonath raised his arm in front of his face as Hecarim closed to striking distance , but instead of being <unk> by the glaive , Jonath was engulfed once more in cloying darkness .
The faces of the dead surrounded him , their <unk> laughter an <unk> to their twisted master ’ s trickery .
Jonath spurred his spectral steed , and as he burst from the mist , Hecarim and the riders disappeared from view .
Night had fallen over the coast as Jonath passed the <unk> at the edge of Havenfall .
The sound of battle had stopped , and the approaches to the town appeared <unk> untouched .
He felt a brief wave of relief .
He would find soldiers here who could fight .
Commander Tyndarid and his garrison would see off the riders on Jonath ’ s trail — for all his <unk> arrogance , the castellan was an <unk> warrior .
Jonath saw war horses , some half saddled and <unk> , some still tied to their hitching <unk> near the <unk> , lay dead .
His heart sank .
As Jonath ’ s destrier carried him further into the settlement , the true horror of the black mist around him became <unk> .
Jonath slowly turned around .
All of this ... couldn ’ t be real .
It had to be a <unk> of his troubled imagination , or some dark <unk> worked by a vengeful <unk> mage .
But his eyes told him otherwise .
In the streets , the spirits of newly dead townsfolk lingered above their own corpses , <unk> in fear , wailing silently , <unk> the instant they were <unk> down by the Iron Order .
<unk> knights of the crown stood mute where they had died <unk> .
As Jonath passed , one by one , spirits fixed their hollow eyes on him .
A knight , his killer ’ s spear still pinning his shield to the shade of his body , made a step toward Jonath .
A gasp escaped his lips as he recognized Commander Tyndarid .
A group of dead <unk> <unk> <unk> their feet and tumbled toward Jonath in agitation .
He kicked his steed and made his escape .
A voice inside him whispered that even in death , they knew he didn ’ t belong .
<unk> raiders <unk> through the merchant <unk> , <unk> survivors and putting <unk> to the roofs of the <unk> and trade posts .
<unk> fire engulfed the buildings and cast a deathly light across the square — the <unk> and wood somehow remaining untouched by the flames .
The townsfolk inside ... Jonath looked away as he rode , willing himself not to hear .
By the harbor , fishing boats and river <unk> lay low against the <unk> pier , <unk> and <unk> .
Jonath looked out over the bay , his gaze drawn across the still water by the long , mournful note of a hunting horn .
A <unk> of spectral riders raced across the calm water in the moonlight , lowering their spears as they neared the last <unk> still afloat .
The charge hit home , followed by the faint <unk> of weapons and the cries of sailors dying .
The ship disappeared from sight in a mass of writhing fog .
The entirety of Havenfall was under <unk> — who knew how much of Demacia was <unk> by this <unk> .
<unk> his mount , Jonath tried to control his fear and find a way out .
Perhaps he should <unk> his own steed off the pier and ride the waters across the bay .
He was unable to <unk> these deathless monsters , but he might <unk> away unnoticed and escape this terrible nightmare ... Jonath was brought back to the present by the sound of <unk> .
He noticed a <unk> of survivors picking their way through the ruined market square .
There were four of them .
A pair of <unk> youths , clearly <unk> by their features , held on to short blades , their eyes darting <unk> across the square .
They <unk> an <unk> woman who followed in their wake , dressed in the <unk> of the <unk> and carrying a steel <unk> .
Jonath knew the <unk> built figure at the head of the group — it was the blacksmith Adamar .
He held a heavy blade and shield , still <unk> and blackened with the soot of its <unk> .
“ Jonath ! ” Adamar called out quietly .
“ We thought we were the last ones left alive .
We ’ re getting away from here .
You are welcome to <unk> — ” The blacksmith fell silent as he saw Jonath ’ s steed .
His eyes hardened with fury , and he ushered the others behind him , <unk> shield held high .
“ You ’ re in <unk> with these monsters ! ” The old Illuminator placed a hand on Adamar ’ s shoulder .
“ Look at his eyes , <unk> .
He ’ s just as afraid as we are .
He ’ s not with them . ” She <unk> Jonath directly .
“ Get off that abomination , child , and come with us . ” “ I wish I could , ” Jonath heard himself say .
The guilt of his actions washed over him , making his head swim .
He saw the dying knight ’ s face again , accusing him .
“ But Adamar ... he ’ s right .
I don ’ t belong here , and I don ’ t deserve your mercy .
You don ’ t know what I did today , who I really am .
I am no Demacian . ” “ Enough of that .
You are Jonath of <unk> ’ s <unk> , not some stranger .
Don ’ t think I haven ’ t noticed you pray at the Protector ’ s shrine after dark .
I know your heart wants to lead you back to <unk> .
I cannot tell you if it will , but tonight all that matters is survival .
There are not many of us left here , and you are one of us .
One of the living .
Now get off that ... thing , and let us leave this place . ” Jonath grabbed the saddle , swinging his leg up to <unk> .
“ Thank the Protector for your mercy — ” Coils of mist ripped open above the town square , spectral riders bursting forth .
Hecarim was at the fore , galloping through thin air , swinging his jagged glaive wide .
Before Jonath understood what he was looking at , the blade struck the Illuminator in the chest , cleaving her in two .
Hecarim ’ s riders <unk> ran through Adamar and the two youths , before <unk> to a halt .
Like the first time Jonath saw them , they became completely still — their spears held <unk> upright , their <unk> and <unk> frozen , only the sound of their motionless <unk> piercing the deathly quiet .
Ever the first of their number , there was Hecarim , hooves scraping the ground , his animal body <unk> back and forth , his eyes burning with ancient <unk> .
Grand Master , <unk> .
<unk> of Havenfall .
How was Jonath meant to stand against the might of this infernal <unk> ?
How was anyone ?
Hecarim closed the distance , riding up alongside Jonath until they stood shoulder to shoulder .
Slowly , he reached down toward the <unk> of Jonath ’ s borrowed steed , <unk> it in place .
The Grand Master was <unk> than Jonath by half .
“ You <unk> yourself well today , ” Hecarim said , the deep , <unk> softened to a growl .
His gaze wandered , settling on the moonlit bay behind Jonath .
“ I have seen kings lose their minds when faced with the Black Mist and the eternal anguish that it brings .
Everyone you ever knew perished this night , yet your will to survive remains unbroken .
Who else are you willing to sacrifice so you can live ?
Are you willing to let even your <unk> die ? ” Jonath ’ s heart pounded , his vision blurred as tears of helpless panic threatened to overwhelm him .
Moments ago , Hecarim had <unk> the last survivors of his <unk> , and now he was <unk> with him as if they had <unk> in some <unk> duel on the training grounds .
“ The ... the king is already dead .
The crown prince , Protector guide his hand , is next in line , and there could be no one more <unk> .
I ... do not want to put him in <unk> for my own gain . ” Hecarim remained still for a moment , then <unk> with <unk> mirth .
“ In the line of <unk> , the crown does not always go to the most <unk> heir .
And what do I care for the frail kingdoms of the living .
We all have to make do with the hand fate <unk> us . ” Up close , Jonath could see the countless pits and <unk> in Hecarim ’ s armor .
He could see endless years of <unk> <unk> into the black-iron plates <unk> the flames that made up his body , and understood a <unk> truth about this creature ...
He had been created by war , and he was made for war .
He had done nothing but battle for centuries , condemned to <unk> his worst <unk> .
Whatever <unk> he had committed in life , this was his punishment .
And he relished every <unk> second of it .
Wherever the unnatural mist went , Hecarim and his Iron Order followed — <unk> , killing , and reveling in the <unk> they inflicted on the living .
What would become of Demacia if no one stopped this evil ?
Jonath finally understood something that had <unk> him his entire life .
Courage wasn ’ t some <unk> quality <unk> into true <unk> at birth , or a measure of his worth to the world .
It was a question of <unk> what must be done , and choosing to do it no matter what .
He felt calm for the first time since the crossroads .
He remembered the wounded knight ’ s dying words , one last time .
There were no soldiers left in Havenfall to <unk> the crown prince , and soon there might be none left in the entire kingdom .
<unk> the Grand Master with his gaze , he pulled the reins from Hecarim ’ s mailed fist , taking control of the destrier .
Hecarim <unk> him , his posture <unk> from introspection to curiosity .
Jonath <unk> , <unk> a few <unk> of distance .
“ I have seen how you ride down <unk> villagers , reveling in the screams of the helpless .
I know you are bound to your basest instincts for eternity , but there is more to you .
If a shred of your living self remains , if you have any honor at all , abomination , you will let me pass ! ” He collected himself .
He knew he would not make it to the Great City , but he was going to try .
The bulk of his <unk> mount tensed as it sensed what was about to happen .
With all his might , Jonath gave it the <unk> , and his spectral steed charged .
For the first time in his life , Jonath truly believed the words as they <unk> from his lips .
“ For the <unk> king !
For Demacia ! ” Hecarim smirked with delight as the boy charged willingly toward the spears of the Iron Order .
The folly of youth had stayed with him until death , a <unk> all too common in Hecarim ’ s experience .
But as long as Viego <unk> his own foolish <unk> across the oceans of the world , trailing the Mist in his wake , Hecarim would enjoy the spoils of war .
Around him , as far as he could see , his riders spread terror and death .
A <unk> grin widened across his burning skull .
“ If but our hands were not bound by <unk> ... ” he <unk> , as he watched the last living soul of Havenfall <unk> .
= = = = = = SHADOW AND FORTUNE = = = = = = = = GRAHAM MCNEILL = = The Butcher <unk> had hung the Jackdaw from a rusted <unk> through his jawbone and left him for the quayside scavengers .
This was the <unk> murdered <unk> the hooded man had seen tonight .
A slow night by Bilgewater &apos;s standards .
At least since the <unk> King had fallen .
<unk> wharf rats had already <unk> most of the hanged man &apos;s feet and were perched on <unk> <unk> to tear at the soft meat of his <unk> .
The hooded man kept on walking .
“ Help .
Me . ” The words were wet , squeezed up through a throat clogged with blood .
The hooded man spun , hands reaching towards the weapons slung on his wide belt .
<unk> , the Jackdaw was still alive on the bone-handled spike .
The <unk> stuck it deep into the wooden frame of a <unk> <unk> .
No way to get the Jackdaw down without tearing his skull to splinters .
“ Help .
Me , ” he said again .
The hooded man paused , <unk> the Jackdaw &apos;s <unk> .
“ What for ? ” he said at last .
“ Even if I get you down from there , you will be dead by morning . ” The Jackdaw carefully lifted his hand to a concealed pocket in his patchwork <unk> and removed a golden Kraken .
Even in the dim light , the hooded man saw it was <unk> .
The scavengers hissed and raised their <unk> as he approached .
Wharf rats weren &apos;t large , but meat as warm as this wasn &apos;t a prize to be surrendered lightly .
They <unk> long , needle-like fangs , spitting <unk> gobbets of saliva .
He kicked one rat out over the water .
He crushed a second underfoot .
They snapped and bit , but <unk> <unk> kept any from tasting his flesh , his every movement smooth and precise .
He killed another three before the rest scattered to the shadows , sullen eyes glaring red in the darkness .
The hooded man stood beside the Jackdaw .
His features were hidden , but the light of a <unk> ’ s moon suggested a face that no longer smiled .
“ Death is here for you , ” he said .
“ Embrace it , safe in the knowledge I will ensure it is final . ” He reached into his coat and withdrew a glittering spike of silver .
Two <unk> long and engraved with curling symbols spiraling along its length , it resembled an ornate , <unk> &apos;s awl .
He placed the tip under the dying man &apos;s chin .
The man &apos;s eyes widened and his hand <unk> at the hooded man &apos;s sleeve as he looked out over the vast expanse of ocean .
The sea was a black mirror shimmering with the glow of myriad candles , quayside braziers and <unk> warped through <unk> glass from a thousand <unk> .
“ You know what <unk> over the horizon , ” he said .
“ You know the horror it brings .
And yet you tear at each other like <unk> beasts .
It makes no sense to me . ” He turned and hammered the heel of his palm against the flattened haft of the awl , driving the spike up into the man &apos;s brain .
A last corpse rattle and the Jackdaw &apos;s pain ended .
The gold coin fell from the dead man &apos;s fingers and rolled into the ocean with a soft <unk> .
The man withdrew the spike and wiped it clean on the Jackdaw &apos;s ragged shirt .
He returned it to the sheath inside his coat and removed a golden needle and a length of silver thread dipped in waters drawn from an Ionian spring .
<unk> with the skill of one who had performed this service many times before , he <unk> the man &apos;s eyes and lips shut .
As he worked , he spoke words taught to him a <unk> ago , words first <unk> by a long dead king .
“ Now the dead cannot claim you , ” he said as he finished his work and replaced his <unk> .
“ Maybe not , but we ain &apos;t leaving <unk> , sure we ain &apos;t , ” said a voice behind the hooded man .
He turned and pulled back his hood to reveal skin the color and texture of <unk> <unk> , cheekbones that were angular and <unk> .
His dark hair was bound in a long <unk> and eyes that had seen horror beyond measure <unk> the newcomers .
<unk> men .
<unk> in <unk> of <unk> leather cut to display limbs of <unk> muscle wrapped with tattooed thorns .
Each carried a <unk> hook and wore <unk> hung with a <unk> of <unk> ’ knives .
<unk> <unk> made <unk> by the fall of the tyrant who &apos;d <unk> Bilgewater with an iron fist .
With him gone , the city was in chaos as rival gangs sought to carve out fresh <unk> .
Their approach hadn ’ t been <unk> .
<unk> boots , <unk> and muttered curses had announced their presence long before they &apos;d revealed themselves .
“ I don &apos;t mind a coin going to the Bearded Lady , sure I don &apos;t , ” said the biggest of the Butchers , a man with a gut so <unk> it was a wonder he could get close enough to a carcass to gut it at all .
“ But one of ours killed Old <unk> <unk> there , fair and square , sure they did .
So that gold <unk> there was ours . ” “ Do you want to die here ? ” asked the man .
The fat man laughed .
“ You know who you &apos;re talking to ? ” “ No .
Do you ? ” “ Go on then , tell me so I can carve it on the rock I &apos;ll use to sink your bones . ” “ My name is Lucian , ” he said , whipping back his long frock coat and drawing a pair of pistols <unk> of <unk> stone and <unk> <unk> unknown to even the most reckless <unk> of Zaun .
A bolt of <unk> light punched the fat Butcher from his feet with a scorched hole where his <unk> swollen heart had been .
Lucian &apos;s second pistol was smaller , more finely crafted , and fired a searing line of yellow fire that cut another of the Butchers in half from collarbone to <unk> .
Like the wharf rats before , they fled , but Lucian picked them off one by one .
Each burst of light was a killing shot .
In the blink of an eye all six Butchers lay dead .
He sheathed his pistols and pulled the coat back around him .
Others would be drawn by the sound and fury of his work , and he had no time to save these men ’ s souls from what was coming .
Lucian sighed .
It had been a mistake to stop for the Jackdaw , but perhaps the man he had once been was not entirely lost .
A memory threatened to surface and he shook his head .
“ I cannot be him again , ” said Lucian .
He isn &apos;t strong enough to kill the Chain Warden .
Olaf ’ s <unk> hauberk was covered in blood and <unk> .
He grunted as he swung his axe <unk> .
<unk> sheared and muscle parted before the weapon , its blade <unk> on a bed of True Ice deep in the farthest reaches of the Freljord .
<unk> a spitting torch in one hand , he <unk> through the dripping innards of the Krakenwyrm , hewing deeper with every swing .
It had taken him three hours to reach this far ; cleaving through its enormous glistening organs and dense bones .
True , the beast was already dead , skewered a week ago after a month ’ s long chase down from the north .
Over thirty <unk> cast by strong arms and <unk> backs from the deck of Winter &apos;s Kiss pierced its <unk> hide , but it had been Olaf &apos;s spear that finally ended its fight .
<unk> the beast in the heart of a churning storm outside Bilgewater had been <unk> , and for one brief moment – as the ship <unk> over and almost tossed him into the beast &apos;s maw – he &apos;d thought this might be the moment he would achieve the glorious death he sought .
But then <unk> the <unk> , curse his mighty shoulder , <unk> the <unk> to right the ship .
And , <unk> , Olaf had lived .
Another day closer to the terror of dying <unk> in his bed as a <unk> ancient .
They &apos;d <unk> in Bilgewater , hoping to sell the carcass and strip it of battle <unk> ; vast teeth , black blood that burned like oil , and titanic <unk> fit to roof his mother ’ s hall .
His fellow <unk> , exhausted from the hunt , were sleeping aboard Winter &apos;s Kiss , but Olaf , ever impatient , could not rest .
Instead , he took up his glittering axe and set to work in <unk> the colossal monster .
Finally he saw the beast ’ s inner maw , a <unk> gullet large enough to swallow a clan whole or <unk> a <unk> Longreaver in a single bite .
Its teeth were <unk> fangs like obsidian <unk> .
Olaf nodded .
“ <unk> .
<unk> to ring a hearth circle of the <unk> and the <unk> of bones and ash . ” He jammed the spiked base of the torch into the meat of the Krakenwyrm ’ s flesh and set to work , hacking at the jawbone until a tooth came loose .
<unk> the axe to his belt , Olaf lifted it clear and set it upon his shoulder , grunting at the enormous weight .
“ Like a <unk> <unk> gathering ice for his lair , ” he said , making his way out of the beast ’ s innards , <unk> <unk> in blood and caustic <unk> <unk> .
Eventually he emerged from the giant wound in the Krakenwyrm ’ s rear and drew in a <unk> of slightly <unk> air .
Even after the innards of the beast , Bilgewater was a rank <unk> of smoke and sweat and dead things .
Its air was heavy with the smell of too many people living packed together like <unk> in a <unk> .
He spat a rank mouthful and said , “ The sooner I am in the north the better . ” The air of the Freljord was so sharp it could cut you to the bone .
Every breath here tasted of <unk> milk and <unk> meat .
“ <unk> ! ” shouted a voice over the water .
Olaf <unk> through the gloom , seeing a lone fisherman <unk> out to sea beyond a line of floating water markers hung with dead birds and bells .
“ That beast just <unk> you out ? ” shouted the fisherman .
Olaf nodded and said , “ I had no gold to pay passage on a ship , so I let it swallow me in the Freljord and bear me south . ” The fisherman grinned and drank from a cracked bottle of blue glass .
“ I ’ d sit and listen to that tall tale , right enough ! ” “ Come to the Winter ’ s Kiss and ask for Olaf , ” he shouted .
“ We ’ ll share a <unk> of <unk> and honor the beast with <unk> of doom . ” The air around the White Wharf usually smelled of <unk> and rotten fish .
Today it tasted of scorched meat and <unk> , a flavor with which Miss Fortune was coming to associate with ever more of Gangplank ’ s men dying .
Ash darkened the sky and <unk> <unk> drifted <unk> from burning <unk> of rendered leviathan <unk> on the Slaughter Docks .
Miss Fortune &apos;s mouth felt <unk> , and she spat onto the crooked timbers of the wharf .
The water below was scummed with residue <unk> by the thousands of corpses sunk beneath the water over the years .
“ You and your men had a <unk> night , ” she said , nodding toward the smoke rising from the western cliffs .
“ Aye , that we did , ” agreed Rafen .
“ <unk> more of Gangplank ’ s men going under today . ” “ How many did you get ? ” asked Miss Fortune .
“ Another ten of his <unk> <unk> , ” said Rafen .
“ And the <unk> <unk> won ’ t be <unk> us again . ” Miss Fortune nodded in approval and turned to look at the ornate bronze cannon laid on the quayside .
<unk> Byrne lay inside the barrel , finally dead from the <unk> he &apos;d taken on the day everything changed ; the day the Dead Pool exploded in full view of Bilgewater .
A <unk> meant for her .
Now it was time for Byrne to go down among the dead men and she <unk> it to him to be there to see him go under .
Around two hundred men and women had come to pay their <unk> ; her own <unk> , Byrne &apos;s old gang <unk> , and strangers she thought might be former <unk> or curious <unk> hoping to see the woman who &apos;d brought down Gangplank .
Byrne said he &apos;d once run his own ship , a <unk> <unk> that was the terror of the Noxian coast , but she only had his word for that .
Maybe that was true , maybe it wasn &apos;t , but in Bilgewater , more often than not the truth was far stranger than any tale spun by the city ’ s many <unk> .
“ I see you got them fighting each other out on the Slaughter Docks as well , ” said Miss Fortune , brushing <unk> of ash from her <unk> .
Long red hair spilled from beneath a tricorn <unk> and gathered on the shoulders of her <unk> frock coat .
“ Yeah , wasn ’ t hard to turn the Rat Town <unk> and Wharf <unk> against each other , ” said Rafen .
“ <unk> Gallar &apos;s always had his eye on that <unk> .
<unk> <unk> &apos;s boys took it from his old man a <unk> ago . ” “ That true ? ” “ Who knows ? ” said Rafen .
“ Don ’ t matter , <unk> .
Gallar would say anything to get control of that part of the docks .
I just helped him along . ” “ Not much left to control over there now . ” “ No , ” agreed Rafen with a grin .
“ They pretty much killed the hell out of each other .
Don &apos;t reckon we &apos;ll get trouble from either of them gangs any time soon . ” “ Another week like this and there won &apos;t be any of Gangplank ’ s people left alive . ” Rafen gave her a strange look and Miss Fortune <unk> not to notice .
“ Come on , let &apos;s get Byrne sunk , ” said Miss Fortune .
They walked over to the cannon , ready to roll it into the sea .
A forest of wooden markers <unk> the scummed surface of the water , ranging from simple wooden <unk> to <unk> <unk> of sea <unk> .
“ Anyone want to say anything ? ” said Miss Fortune .
Nobody did , and she nodded to Rafen , but before they could tip the cannon into the water , a <unk> voice echoed over the wharf .
“ I bring words for him . ” Miss Fortune turned to see a giant of a woman clad in <unk> robes and <unk> of fabric <unk> down the docks towards them .
A <unk> of tattooed <unk> accompanied her ; a dozen youths armed with <unk> spears , <unk> pistols and hooked <unk> .
They <unk> like the <unk> <unk> they were , standing with their priestess like they owned the docks .
“ Seven <unk> , what &apos;s she doing here ? ” “ Did Illaoi know Byrne ? ” “ No .
She knows me , ” said Miss Fortune .
“ I heard that her and Gangplank used to ... you know ? ” “ <unk> ? ” “ So the <unk> goes . ” “ By the Bearded Lady , no wonder <unk> &apos;s men have been giving us such a hard time these last few weeks . ” Illaoi carried a heavy stone sphere that looked as if it weighed about as much as the <unk> &apos;s anchor .
The towering priestess carried it everywhere she went , and Miss Fortune assumed it was some kind of totem .
What everyone else called the Bearded Lady , they called something <unk> <unk> .
Illaoi <unk> a peeled mango from somewhere and took a bite .
She <unk> <unk> the fruit with her mouth open and looked down the barrel of the cannon .
“ A Bilgewater man <unk> a <unk> of Nagakabouros , yes ? ” “ Why not ? ” said Miss Fortune .
“ He &apos;s going down to meet the goddess , after all . ” “ Nagakabouros doesn &apos;t live in the depths , ” said Illaoi .
“ Only foolish <unk> think that .
Nagakabouros is in everything we do that moves us along our path . ” “ Yeah , how stupid of me , ” said Miss Fortune .
Illaoi spat the <unk> mango pit into the water and swung the stone idol around like a giant <unk> , holding it up in front of Miss Fortune .
“ You &apos;re not stupid , Sarah , ” said Illaoi with a laugh .
“ But you don &apos;t even know what you are , what you <unk> done . ” “ Why are you really here , Illaoi ?
Is this about him ? ” “ Ha !
Not even a little bit , ” snorted Illaoi .
“ My life is for Nagakabouros .
A god or a man ?
What choice is that ? ” “ None at all , ” said Miss Fortune .
“ <unk> luck for Gangplank . ” Illaoi grinned , exposing a mouthful of pulped mango .
“ You &apos;re not wrong , ” she said with a slow nod , “ but you still don &apos;t hear .
You let a razor-eel off the hook and you ought to stamp on its neck and walk away before it sinks its fangs into you .
Then your motion will be gone forever . ” “ What does that mean ? ” “ Come and see me when you figure it out , ” said Illaoi , holding out her hand .
<unk> in her palm was a pendant of pink coral arranged in a series of curves radiating from a <unk> <unk> like a single , unblinking eye .
“ Take it , ” said Illaoi .
“ What is it ? ” “ A <unk> of Nagakabouros to guide you when you ’ re lost . ” “ What is it really ? ” “ Nothing more than I say . ” Miss Fortune hesitated , but too many people were gathered for her to <unk> <unk> a priestess of the Bearded Lady by refusing her gift .
She took the pendant and removed her tricorn to <unk> the leather <unk> around her neck .
Illaoi leaned in to whisper .
“ I don ’ t think you &apos;re stupid , ” she said .
“ <unk> me right . ” “ Why do I care what you think ? ” said Miss Fortune .
“ Because a storm is coming , ” said Illaoi , nodding at something over Miss Fortune &apos;s shoulder .
“ You know the one , so you best be ready to turn your prow into the waves . ” She turned and kicked Byrne &apos;s cannon from the dock .
It splashed down hard and sank in a froth of bubbles before the <unk> surface residue reformed , leaving only its bobbing <unk> cross to <unk> who was below .
The priestess of the Bearded Lady marched back the way she had come , towards her temple in the <unk> , and Miss Fortune turned her gaze out to sea .
A storm was <unk> way out in the deep ocean , but that wasn &apos;t where Illaoi had been looking .
She &apos;d been looking towards the Shadow Isles .
Nobody ever <unk> Bilgewater Bay at night .
Piet knew why , of course ; he ’ d known these waters all his life .
The <unk> were treacherous , <unk> rocks lurked just below the surface , and the seabed was <unk> with the <unk> of ships whose <unk> had not <unk> the sea its proper respect .
But , more importantly , everyone knew the spirits of those drowned at sea were lonely and wanted others to join them .
Piet knew all this , but still needed to feed his family .
With Captain <unk> ’ s ship burned to cinders in the <unk> between Gangplank and Miss Fortune , Piet had no work and no coin to pay for food .
He ’ d drunk half a bottle of <unk> ’ s Scrumpy just to pluck up the courage to push his boat out onto the water tonight , and the prospect of sharing a drink with the giant Freljordian helped steady his nerves .
Piet took another <unk> from the bottle , tugging the <unk> of hair on his chin , then pouring a measure over the side to honor the Bearded Lady .
<unk> and numbed by the <unk> , Piet rowed past the warning buoys and their dead birds until he came to a <unk> of ocean where he ’ d had some luck the previous night .
<unk> always said he had a nose for where the fish were biting , and he had a feeling they ’ d be gathering where the remains of the Dead Pool had drifted .
Piet pulled in the oars and stowed them before finishing off the Scrumpy .
Then , making sure to leave a last mouthful in the bottle , he tossed it out to sea .
With tired , <unk> fingers he baited his hooks with <unk> he ’ d <unk> from a dead man ’ s eye and tied his lines to the gunwale <unk> .
He closed his eyes and bent over the side of the boat , placing both hands in the water .
“ Nagakabouros , ” he said , hoping that <unk> the natives ’ name for the Bearded Lady might grant him a bit of luck , “ I ain ’ t asking for much .
Please help this poor fisherman and spare him a few <unk> from your <unk> .
<unk> over me and keep me safe .
And if I die in your embrace , keep me down among the dead men . ” Piet opened his eyes .
A pale face stared back at him , wavering just below the surface .
It shimmered with cold , lifeless light .
He cried out and <unk> back into his boat as , one by one , his fishing lines were pulled taut .
They spun his boat around as thin <unk> of mist rose from the water .
The mist thickened swiftly and soon the light from Bilgewater ’ s cliffs was lost to the darkness as <unk> fog rolled in from the sea .
A cacophony of <unk> birds <unk> from the warning markers , followed by the clamor of bells as their <unk> bodies swung the buoys back and forth .
The black mist ... Piet scrambled for his oars , fumbling in terror to fit them to the <unk> .
The mist was <unk> cold , and lines of necrotic black <unk> his skin at its touch .
He wept as the grave ’ s chill frosted his spine .
“ Bearded Lady , <unk> Below , Nagakabouros , ” he sobbed .
“ Please guide me home .
Please , this I beg <unk> ” Piet never finished his plea .
A pair of <unk> chains erupted from his chest , <unk> of <unk> red blood streaming from their tips .
A third hook punched through his belly , another his throat .
A <unk> and <unk> gouged his palms and pulled them down hard , pinning Piet to his boat .
<unk> surged through him and he screamed as a figure of purest malice emerged from the black mist .
<unk> fire <unk> its <unk> skull , and <unk> gouged by vengeful spirits burned as they savored his pain .
The dead spirit was robed in ancient black vestments , and rusted <unk> scraped at its side .
A chained <unk> moaned and swayed with monstrous appetite from its clenched fist .
The glass of the infernal lantern opened to receive him , and Piet felt his spirit tear loose from the warmth of his flesh .
The <unk> of tortured souls shrieked from its depths , <unk> by their unending <unk> .
Piet fought to keep his spirit within his body , but a spectral blade <unk> and his time in the world was ended as the glass of the lantern snapped shut .
“ A wretched soul you are , ” said the reaper of his life , its voice like gravel on a <unk> .
“ But only the first to be claimed by Thresh this night . ” The black mist rippled , and the silhouettes of <unk> spirits , howling wraiths and ghostly horsemen swelled within .
The darkness boiled across the sea and swept onto land .
And the lights in Bilgewater started to go out .
Miss Fortune snapped the barrels of her pistols shut and laid them down on the table next to her <unk> sword .
<unk> of frantic bells and shouts of alarm echoed from the panicked city below ; she knew well what they <unk> .
The Harrowing .
In defiance of the incoming storm , she ’ d kept the shuttered windows of her <unk> villa open , daring the dead to come for her .
Muttering winds carried their hunger and a cold that settled <unk> .
<unk> high on Bilgewater ’ s eastern cliffs , the villa had once belonged to a hated gang leader .
In the chaos of Gangplank ’ s fall , he ’ d been dragged from his bed and had his <unk> <unk> out on the cobbles .
Now it belonged to Miss Fortune , and she ’ d be damned if she ’ d go the same way .
She reached up and ran a <unk> around the curves of the pendant Illaoi had given her at Byrne ’ s sinking .
The coral was warm to the touch , and though she didn ’ t truly believe in what it <unk> , it was a pretty enough <unk> .
The door to her <unk> opened and she let the pendant drop .
She knew who was behind her without turning .
Only one man would dare <unk> without knocking .
“ What are you doing ? ” asked Rafen .
“ What does it look like I ’ m doing ? ” “ Like you ’ re about to do something damned stupid . ” “ <unk> ? ” said Miss Fortune , placing her hands on the table .
“ We shed blood and lost good people to bring down Gangplank .
I ’ m not going to let the Harrowing <unk> ” “ Just what ? ” “ Take this place from me , ” she snapped lifting her pistols and <unk> them into their <unk> <unk> <unk> .
“ And you ’ re not going to stop me . ” “ We ’ re not here to stop you . ” Miss Fortune turned to see Rafen at the threshold of her chambers .
A score of her best fighters waited in the <unk> beyond , armed to the teeth with a <unk> of muskets , wheel-lock pistols , clanking <unk> of clay <unk> and <unk> that looked like they ’ d been looted from a <unk> .
“ <unk> like you ’ re about to do something damned stupid as well , ” she said .
“ Aye , ” agreed Rafen , walking over to the open window and slamming the shutters closed .
“ You really think we ’ d let our captain go out to face that alone ? ” “ I almost died bringing Gangplank down , and I ’ m not done yet .
I don ’ t expect you to go with me , not tonight , ” said Miss Fortune coming to stand before her men and resting her hands on the carved <unk> grips of her guns .
“ This isn ’ t your fight . ” “ Course it bloody is , ” said Rafen .
Miss Fortune took a breath and nodded .
“ There ’ s every chance we won ’ t live to see morning , ” she said , unable to keep the hint of a smile tugging at her lip .
“ This ain ’ t our first Harrowing together , Captain , ” said Rafen , tapping the skull pommel of his sword .
“ And I ’ ll be damned if it ’ s our last . ” Olaf was in sight of the Winter ’ s Kiss when he heard the screams .
He ignored them at first – screams were nothing new in Bilgewater – but then he saw men and women running from the quayside in terror , and his interest was <unk> .
They scrambled from their boats and fled for the crooked streets as fast as they could .
They didn ’ t look back and they didn ’ t stop , not even when a shipmate tripped or fell into the water .
Olaf had seen men run from battle , but this was something else .
This was naked terror , the kind he ’ d only ever seen etched on the frozen corpses spat out by <unk> where the Ice Witch was said to dwell .
Shutters were slamming shut all across the wharf and the strange symbols he ’ d seen on every door were frantically being <unk> with white powder .
<unk> <unk> were lifting timber structures formed from <unk> hulls of ships high up the cliffs .
He recognized a tavern-keeper who ran a drinking <unk> where the beer was only slightly stronger than troll <unk> and waved to him .
“ What ’ s going on ? ” shouted Olaf .
The tavern-keeper shook his head and pointed to the ocean before slamming his door .
Olaf set the Krakenwyrm ’ s tooth on the stone wharf and turned to see what all the <unk> was about .
At first he thought a storm was coming in , but it was just thick black sea fog , <unk> fog that approached with unnatural speed and <unk> motion .
“ Ah , now , ” he said , <unk> his axe from his belt .
“ This looks promising . ” The feel of the weapon ’ s <unk> leather grip was pleasing in his <unk> palm as he passed it from hand to hand , rolling his shoulders to <unk> the muscles .
The black mist swept over the farthest ships and Olaf ’ s eyes widened as he saw spirits plucked from the <unk> nightmares writhing in the mist .
A towering <unk> , a monstrous <unk> of warhorse and man , led them alongside a <unk> reaper limned in green fire .
These lords of the dead left the spirit host to their sport on the quayside as they flew into Bilgewater proper with predatory speed .
Olaf had heard the natives speak in hushed whispers of something called the Harrowing , a time of doom and darkness , but hadn ’ t expected to be lucky enough to face it axe in hand .
The host of the dead tore into the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , and corsair ships with claw and fang , ripping them apart like an <unk> with its snout in a fresh kill .
<unk> tore and <unk> lines snapped as easily as rotten sinew .
<unk> masts splintered as boats were tossed into one another and smashed to kindling .
A host of screaming wraiths flew into the Winter ’ s Kiss and Olaf roared in anger as the Longreaver ’ s <unk> heaved and split , its timbers freezing solid in a heartbeat .
The boat sank as swiftly as if its hold were filled with rocks , and Olaf saw his fellow <unk> dragged below the water by creatures with <unk> limbs and <unk> mouths .
“ Olaf will make you wish you had stayed dead ! ” he yelled as he charged along the wharf .
<unk> boiled up from the ocean , icy claws slashing towards him .
Olaf ’ s axe sang out , cleaving a glittering arc through the host .
The dead screeched as his blade sundered them , its True Ice edge more lethal than any <unk> .
They howled as they died a second time and Olaf sang the song he ’ d written for the moment of his death with <unk> <unk> .
The words were simple , but the <unk> of any saga told by the wandering poets of the ice .
How long had he waited to sing these words ?
How often had he feared he might never get the chance ?
A shimmering mist of snapping jaws <unk> him , <unk> and things of mist .
<unk> of frost <unk> his hauberk and the deathly touch of <unk> spirits burned his skin .
But Olaf ’ s heart was mighty and it fired his blood to heights of fury unknown to all but the berserker .
He shrugged off the pain of the wraith touch , feeling reason <unk> and fury build .
<unk> froth built at the corners of his mouth as he bit the inside of his cheeks raw .
He roared and swung his axe like a madman , caring nothing for pain , only that he slew his enemies .
That they were dead already meant nothing to him .
Olaf drew his axe back , ready to strike another blow , when a deafening crash of splintering columns and roof beams erupted behind him .
He spun to face this new foe as a blizzard of smashed wood and stone cascaded onto the quayside .
Bladed shards sliced his face and <unk> <unk> of stone <unk> his arms raw .
<unk> <unk> and animal <unk> fell in a rank <unk> as a <unk> groaning <unk> from the black mist .
Then he saw it .
The spirit of the Krakenwyrm arose from the remains of the Slaughter <unk> .
<unk> and filled with fury , its ghostly tentacles lifted into the air and smashed down like <unk> hurled by a <unk> god .
An entire street was smashed to ruin in the blink of an eye and Olaf ’ s berserker fury surged as he finally <unk> a foe worthy of <unk> his life .
Olaf raised his axe in salute of his killer .
“ <unk> beauty ! ” he yelled and charged to his doom .
The woman was beautiful , with wide , almond shaped eyes , full lips and the high cheekbones common to Demacia .
The <unk> in the locket was a <unk> masterpiece , but it failed to <unk> the depth of Senna ’ s strength and determination .
He rarely looked at her picture , knowing that to carry his grief too close to his heart made him weak .
<unk> was a <unk> in his armor .
Lucian could not allow himself to truly feel her loss , so he snapped the locket shut .
He knew he should bury it in the sand of this cave beneath the cliffs , but could not put her memory below the earth as he had her body .
He would shut the grief away until Thresh was destroyed and Senna ’ s death <unk> .
Then , and only then , would Lucian mourn his lost wife with tears and <unk> to the <unk> Lady .
How long had it been since that terrible night ?
He felt the bottomless abyss of sorrow lurking in ambush and <unk> suppressed it as he had so many times before .
He drew on the <unk> of his order , repeating the mantras he and Senna had been taught to close themselves off from emotion .
Only then could he reach a place of <unk> that would allow him to face deathly horrors beyond imagining .
The grief <unk> slowly , but it remained .
He ’ d opened the locket only <unk> , feeling a growing distance between himself and Senna ’ s memory .
He found he could no longer <unk> the <unk> <unk> of her jawline , the <unk> of her skin or the precise color of her eyes .
The longer his hunt went on , the further away she felt .
Lucian lifted his head , letting the breath ease from his lungs , forcing his heartbeat to slow .
The walls of the cave were pale <unk> , gouged from the cliffs upon which Bilgewater was built .
The motion of water and the stone picks of the natives had crafted a <unk> beneath the city few knew of or even suspected existed .
The pale rock walls were etched with looping spirals , rippling waves and things that might have been unblinking eyes .
He ’ d learned these were symbols of the native <unk> , but whoever had carved them had not <unk> this place in many years .
He ’ d found it by following the secret symbols of his own order , symbols that would guide him to places of refuge and <unk> in any city of Valoran .
Only dim reflections of light shimmered on the roof of the cave , but as his eyes followed the spiral of carvings , a shimmering radiance spread from his palm .
Let me be your shield .
Lucian looked down , the memory of her words as clear as though she stood next to him .
The locket <unk> with lambent green flame .
He <unk> the chain of the locket around his neck and swept up his twin relic pistols .
“ Thresh , ” he whispered .
Bilgewater ’ s streets were <unk> .
The bells from the ocean were still ringing and cries of terror echoed from below .
Rat Town was completely covered by the Black Mist , and howling storms raged over <unk> <unk> ’ s <unk> .
<unk> burned all along Butcher ’ s Bridge and a shimmering fog clung to the cliffs above the <unk> <unk> .
The people in the upper reaches of the city hid in their homes and prayed to the Bearded Lady that the Harrowing would pass them by , that grief would fall upon some other poor unfortunate .
<unk> candles of <unk> burned in every window , shimmering through bottle green <unk> .
Burning roots of Empress of the Dark <unk> hung from doors , shutters and nailed up planks .
“ People really believe in the Empress ? ” asked Miss Fortune .
Rafen shrugged , his mouth a thin line and the <unk> around his eyes pulled tight as he <unk> the gathering mist for threats .
He pulled out a smoldering length of <unk> root from beneath his shirt .
“ It ’ s all about where you place your faith , isn ’ t it ? ” Miss Fortune drew her pistols .
“ I have faith in these and in us , ” she said .
“ What else are you carrying ? ” “ This cutlass has kept me safe through six Harrowings , ” he said , tapping its pommel again .
“ I offered up a bottle of ten year old rum to the Bearded Lady and this knife here was sold to me by a man who <unk> its edge was purest <unk> . ” Miss Fortune glanced at the scabbarded knife , certain without even seeing the blade that Rafen had been <unk> .
The <unk> around the quillons was too poor to be Demacian , but she wasn ’ t about to tell him that .
“ What about you ? ” he asked .
Miss Fortune patted her pouch of pistol shot .
“ Every one ’ s been dipped in <unk> ’ s Dark , ” she said , loud enough for every one of her <unk> company to hear .
“ If the dead want a fight , we ’ ll meet them with spirits of our own . ” The <unk> gloom made it hard to laugh , but she saw a few smiles and that was about as much as she could expect on a night like this .
She turned and pushed down into Bilgewater , descending crooked <unk> cut into the rock of the cliffs , crossing secret bridges of <unk> rope and threading forgotten alleys that hadn ’ t known the tread of feet in years .
She brought them out into a wide square on one of the floating <unk> , where swaying dwellings leaned together as though their twisted <unk> whispered to one another .
Every façade was a <unk> of driftwood , and patterns of frost clung to the <unk> timbers .
<unk> winds blew through the patchwork dwellings , <unk> with <unk> and screams from afar .
<unk> braziers hung from hundreds of <unk> <unk> between buildings , <unk> with strange herbs .
<unk> of water rippled with reflections of things that weren ’ t there .
Most days this was a <unk> <unk> , packed to the <unk> with <unk> , rattling <unk> , <unk> , merchants , pirates , bounty hunters and <unk> <unk> washed in from every corner of the world .
Just about everywhere in Bilgewater had a view of this place , which was just how Miss Fortune wanted it .
Mist clung to every <unk> of timber .
<unk> <unk> wept frozen tears .
Mist and shadows gathered .
“ Cutpurse Square ? ” said Rafen .
“ How did we get here ?
I ran this place as a <unk> .
<unk> I knew every way in and out like any good little thief . ” “ Not every way , ” said Miss Fortune .
The <unk> houses on either side were silent and dark , and she resisted the impulse to look through the torn <unk> of flapping canvas nailed over <unk> windows .
“ How do you know these routes and I don ’ t ? ” “ Lady Bilgewater and I are two of a kind , ” said Miss Fortune , her gaze narrowing as black mist seeped into the square .
“ She whispers her secrets to me like an old friend , so I know her every hidden <unk> and <unk> like you never will . ” Rafen grunted as they spread into the empty square .
“ What next ? ” “ We wait , ” said Miss Fortune as they reached the center of the square , feeling <unk> <unk> .
The black mist twitched with things moving in its depths .
A <unk> skull of ghostly light stretched from the darkness , <unk> and with sharpened teeth .
Its jaw stretched <unk> than any natural bone structure would allow and a keening wail built in its gullet .
Miss Fortune ’ s bullets punched through each of its <unk> and the skull vanished with a shriek of frustration .
She twisted the wheel-lock on each pistol and <unk> <unk> within <unk> each one .
For a moment , all was silent .
Then the black mist erupted in a screeching howl as the spirits of the dead surged into the square .
For the second time this evening , Olaf cut his way inside the dead Krakenwyrm .
He wielded his axe like a <unk> <unk> , hewing left and right with <unk> abandon .
The beast ’ s vast limbs were insubstantial as mist , yet the ice of his blade clove them like flesh .
<unk> flailed and slammed down on the stone of the wharf , but Olaf was fast for a big man .
<unk> warriors didn ’ t survive in the Freljord .
He rolled and slashed with his axe , <unk> a <unk> length of limb that faded from existence as it was parted from the monster ’ s body .
Even in the grip of the red shroud , Olaf saw the creature ’ s skull in the thrashing chaos of phantom limbs surrounding him .
Its eyes were <unk> with the <unk> spirit of its life .
A moment of <unk> <unk> passed between them .
The beast ’ s soul knew him .
Olaf laughed with joy .
“ You see the <unk> of your life and we are now <unk> in death ! ” he roared .
“ <unk> if you kill me , we shall battle forever in the realms beyond mortal <unk> . ” The prospect of eternal war against so mighty a foe poured fresh strength into Olaf ’ s aching muscles .
He charged towards the creature ’ s maw , caring nothing for his pain as each <unk> with the Krakenwyrm ’ s tentacles burned his skin worse than the <unk> of the <unk> coast .
He leapt into the air , axe aloft .
He looked glorious death in the face .
A tentacle whipped out and lashed around his <unk> .
It swung him around in a dizzying arc , lifting him high into the air .
“ Come then ! ” bellowed Olaf , punching his axe skyward in salute of their shared destiny .
“ <unk> death ! ” A <unk> with grasping talons and a mouth of icy fangs lunged from the swirling mass of spirits .
Miss Fortune put a bullet through its face and it vanished like smoke in a gale .
A second shot and another spirit vanished .
She grinned through her fear as she spun into cover behind a <unk> stone <unk> of the River King to <unk> .
On impulse , she leaned over and gave his <unk> grin a <unk> .
It ’ s all about where you place your faith .
Gods , bullets or her own skill ?
The grin fell from her face as one of the pistols jammed with a grinding <unk> of metal .
Her mother ’ s <unk> words arose from the dark <unk> of memory .
“ That ’ s what you get when someone else <unk> your powder , Sarah , ” she said , <unk> the gun and sliding her sword from its sheath .
She ’ d looted it from the captain of a Demacian <unk> running north up the Shuriman <unk> , and it was as fine an <unk> of the <unk> ’ s <unk> as any she ’ d seen .
Miss Fortune spun from cover , firing her loaded pistol and slashing her sword through the mist creatures .
Her shot plucked another specter from the air and her sword ’ s edge bit as if cutting flesh and bone .
Did the spirits of the dead have a physical <unk> to them that could be hurt ?
It seemed <unk> , but she was <unk> something inside them .
She didn ’ t have time to think too hard on the matter and suspected that whatever power she ’ d tapped into would be undone if she did .
Men and women screamed as the howling storm of dead spirits filled Cutpurse Square , slashing with claws that froze their blood or reached into chests and sundered hearts with terror .
Seven were dead , maybe more , their souls wrenched from their fallen corpses to turn on their <unk> .
Her <unk> band fought with blades and muskets , shouting the name of the Bearded Lady , their loved ones , and even <unk> gods of faraway lands .
Whatever works , thought Miss Fortune .
Rafen was down on one knee , his face ashen , breathing like a <unk> <unk> after a long shift .
<unk> of mist clung to him like cobwebs and the smoldering root around his neck burned with a fierce <unk> red glow .
“ On your feet , this fight isn ’ t done ! ” she said .
“ Don ’ t tell me the fight ’ s not done , ” he snapped , pushing himself to his feet .
“ I ’ ve been through more Harrowings than you could <unk> a dead rat ’ s tail around . ” Before Miss Fortune could ask exactly what that meant , he leaned to the side and fired his pistol at something behind her .
A conjoined spirit of wolf and <unk> screeched as it was banished , and Miss Fortune returned the <unk> as a spirit form of grasping hooks and snapping fangs lunged at her second in command .
“ Everyone down ! ” shouted Miss Fortune , plucking a pair of splinter <unk> from her belt and <unk> them into the howling mist .
They <unk> in a deafening <unk> of fire and smoke .
Wood splinters and fragments of stone <unk> .
Broken glass fell in a glittering rain of daggers .
<unk> fog filled the square , but it was <unk> and entirely <unk> of spirits .
Rafen shook his head and worked a finger in his ear .
“ What was in that <unk> ? ” “ Black <unk> <unk> with essence of <unk> and <unk> , ” said Miss Fortune .
“ One from my special <unk> . ” “ And stuff like that works against the dead ? ” “ My mother believed in it , ” she said .
“ Good enough for me , ” said Rafen .
“ You know , we might just make it <unk> ” “ Don ’ t say it , ” warned Miss Fortune .
The mist began coalescing throughout the square , first in thin tendrils and wisps , then in glowing outlines of monsters ; things with conjoined legs , <unk> jaws , and arms that ended in hooks or <unk> .
The spirits they thought they ’ d killed .
<unk> , returning .
What was it folk said about <unk> and the <unk> of a <unk> ?
“ <unk> out the dead are pretty hard to kill , ” said Miss Fortune , trying not to let her fear show .
She ’ d been <unk> to think petty trinkets and blind faith were enough to face the spirits of the dead .
She ’ d wanted to show the people of Bilgewater they didn ’ t need Gangplank , that they could forge their own destiny .
Instead , she was going to get herself killed and leave the city to be torn apart .
A <unk> <unk> rolled through the square .
Then another .
<unk> thunder strikes , rising in a stalking storm .
It grew to become pounding <unk> upon an <unk> .
<unk> and louder until the ground shook with its violence .
“ What in the nine <unk> is that ? ” said Rafen .
“ I don ’ t know , ” said Miss Fortune as the outline of a spectral horseman in midnight plate emerged from the mist .
He sat atop a <unk> <unk> warhorse and his helm was worked in the form of a <unk> demon .
“ A dread knight , ” said Miss Fortune .
Rafen shook his head , his face drained of color .
“ That ’ s no knight , ” he said .
“ That ’ s the Shadow of War … ” <unk> terror rippled through Miss Fortune ’ s company at the mention of this eternal nightmare of killing rage and endless fury .
The Shadow of War .
His name was once Hecarim , but no one knew if that were true or some ancient <unk> ’ s invention .
Only <unk> dared <unk> his dark legend around the <unk> , and even then only after enough rum to sink a Noxian <unk> .
As the Shadow of War emerged further from the mist , Miss Fortune saw he was no <unk> horseman .
<unk> dread settled upon her like a shroud at the sight of the monstrous creature .
Perhaps Hecarim had once been a knight , man and horse separate entities .
But rider and mount were now one , a single , towering <unk> whose only purpose was destruction .
“ They ’ re all around us , ” said a voice .
Miss Fortune <unk> looking away from the armored <unk> to see a whole host of ghostly knights , their outlines lambent with <unk> green radiance .
They leveled lances or drew swords of dark radiance .
Hecarim swept out a hooked and terrible glaive , its killing edge erupting with green fire .
“ You know any secret ways out of here ? ” asked Rafen .
“ No , ” said Miss Fortune .
“ I want to fight that bastard . ” “ You want to fight the Shadow of War ? ” Before Miss Fortune could answer , a hooded figure leapt from the rooftop of a <unk> store and dropped into the square .
He landed <unk> , a storm coat of worn leather <unk> behind him .
He carried two pistols , but they were like no weapons Miss Fortune had ever seen on her mother ’ s <unk> ; <unk> <unk> braced around <unk> of what looked like carved stone .
Light filled the square as he loosed searing bolts from each pistol in a <unk> that put the destruction of the Dead Pool to shame .
The man turned in a tight spiral , marking <unk> and picking them off with <unk> motion .
The mist burned where his bolts struck , and the ghostly wraiths screeched as they were consumed .
The mist withdrew from Cutpurse Square , taking Hecarim and the death knights with it .
Something told Miss Fortune this was but a temporary respite .
The man <unk> his pistols and turned to look at Miss Fortune , throwing back his hood to reveal darkly handsome features with haunted eyes .
“ The thing about shadows , ” he said .
“ <unk> enough light and they disappear . ” Olaf was not happy with this doom .
He hoped men would speak of his <unk> battle with the Krakenwyrm , not this <unk> fall to his death .
He hoped someone might have seen him charge the sea beast .
He prayed at least one observer had seen him lifted high into the air by its ghostly tentacle , then fled before seeing him hurled away like an unworthy <unk> .
Olaf crashed down through the roof of a building bolted to the side of the cliff .
Maybe it was a ship ’ s hull ?
He fell too fast to make it out .
<unk> timbers and <unk> tumbled with him in his <unk> <unk> through the building .
He glimpsed <unk> , shouting faces flash past him .
Olaf smashed through a floor .
A <unk> beam drove the wind from him as he tumbled down Bilgewater ’ s cliffs .
He bounced from an <unk> of rock and went headfirst through an open window , crashing out again through yet another floor .
<unk> curses followed him down .
He spun out into a trailing forest of ropes and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
He thrashed as he fell , <unk> his limbs and weapon .
<unk> was mocking him , <unk> him in a folded shroud of canvas sailcloth .
“ Not like this , damn it ! ” he roared .
“ Not like this ! ” “ Who are you and where can I get a pair of guns like those ? ” said Miss Fortune , offering her hand to the new arrival .
“ My name is Lucian , ” he said , <unk> taking her hand .
“ <unk> glad to know you , friend , ” said Rafen , <unk> him on the back as if they were old <unk> .
Miss Fortune saw Rafen ’ s familiarity made Lucian <unk> <unk> , like he ’ d forgotten how to be around others .
His eyes scanned the edges of the square , his fingers dancing on the grips of his pistols .
“ You ’ re a welcome sight , Lucian , ” said Miss Fortune .
“ We should move . ” he said .
“ The Shadow of War will return . ” “ He ’ s right , ” said Rafen , giving her an imploring look .
“ It ’ s time to get inside , <unk> down the <unk> . ” “ No .
We came out to fight . ” “ Look , I get it , Sarah .
We won Bilgewater and you need to fight to hold onto it , to show everyone you ’ re better than Gangplank .
Well , you ’ ve done that .
We went out into the Black Mist and we fought the dead .
That ’ s more than he ever did .
Anyone who risks <unk> ’ out a window is gonna know that .
<unk> , even the ones who ain ’ t looking will hear about it .
What more do you want ? ” “ To fight for Bilgewater . ” “ There ’ s fighting for Bilgewater and then there ’ s dying for Bilgewater , ” said Rafen .
“ I ’ m all up for the first , not so much the second .
These men and women followed you down into hell , but now it ’ s time to climb back out . ” Miss Fortune faced her company of fighters , every ragged , <unk> one of them .
None of them could be trusted not to sell their own <unk> for a <unk> trinket , but they ’ d done everything and more she ’ d asked of them .
<unk> out into the Black Mist was just about the <unk> thing any of them had ever done and she couldn ’ t <unk> that by leading them to their deaths for the sake of her vengeance .
“ You ’ re right , ” she said , taking a breath .
“ We ’ re done here . ” “ Then may fortune follow you , ” said Lucian , turning away and drawing his strange pistols once again .
“ Wait , ” said Miss Fortune .
“ Come with us . ” Lucian shook his head .
“ No , there is a mist wraith I need to destroy .
The one they call Thresh , the Chain Warden .
I owe him a death . ” Miss Fortune saw the lines around Lucian ’ s eyes <unk> and recognized the expression she ’ d worn ever since her mother ’ s <unk> .
“ He took someone from you , didn ’ t he ? ” she said .
Lucian nodded slowly , and said no more , but his very silence spoke volumes .
“ This clearly isn ’ t your first <unk> with the dead , ” she said , “ but you won ’ t survive the night if you stay out here alone .
I ’ m <unk> that might not mean much to you , but whoever this Thresh took from you , they wouldn ’ t want you to die here . ” Lucian ’ s eyes flicked downwards , and Miss Fortune saw a silver locket just visible round his neck .
Was it her imagination or a trick of the mist that made it <unk> in the moonlight ?
“ Come with us , ” said Miss Fortune .
“ Find somewhere safe <unk> morning and you ’ ll live to do it again . ” “ <unk> ?
Where is safe in this city ? ” said Lucian .
“ I think I might know a place , ” said Miss Fortune .
They left Cutpurse Square and were traveling west up towards the Serpent Bridge when they found the Freljordian .
He hung from a crooked spar like a shrouded corpse on a <unk> .
<unk> most corpses , however , this one was thrashing like a landed fish .
A splintered pile of debris lay scattered all around him , and Miss Fortune looked up to see how far he ’ d fallen through the <unk> dwellings .
A long way was the answer , and that he was still alive was nothing short of a <unk> .
Lucian leveled his pistols , but she shook her head .
“ No , this one ’ s actually on the right side of the grave . ” <unk> cries came from within the shroud , curses that would get a man beaten to death in a host of different lands , shouted in a thick , Freljordian accent .
She placed the tip of her sword against the canvas and sliced downwards .
Like a <unk> <unk> pulled from a ruptured <unk> , a <unk> bearded man spilled onto the cobbles .
The reek of fish guts and offal clung to him .
He climbed <unk> to his feet , <unk> an axe with a blade like a <unk> of diamond ice .
“ Which way to the Slaughter Docks ? ” he said , weaving like a drunk .
He looked around , confused , his head a mass of lumps and bruises .
“ Ordinarily I ’ d tell you to follow your nose , ” said Miss Fortune , “ but I ’ d be <unk> if you ’ ve any sense of smell left . ” “ I ’ ll kill that Krakenwyrm ten times over if I have to , ” said the man .
“ I owe it a death . ” “ <unk> of that going around tonight , ” said Miss Fortune .
The Freljordian named himself Olaf , a warrior of the <unk> mistress of the ice , and , after shaking off his <unk> , <unk> his <unk> to join them until he could fight the most dangerous spirit within the Black Mist .
“ Do you want to die ? ” Lucian asked him .
“ Of course , ” said Olaf , as though the very question was the height of foolishness .
“ I seek an ending worthy of legend . ” Miss Fortune left the madman to his dreams of death .
So long as he swung that axe in the right direction , he was welcome to join them as they pushed onwards .
Three times the mist closed in on them , and each time it took an unlucky soul from their company .
<unk> laughter echoed from the sides of buildings , the sound of a <unk> over rusted steel .
<unk> of carrion birds <unk> from rooftops in anticipation of a flesh banquet by the light of the moon .
<unk> lights danced in the darkness of the mist , like beguiling <unk> over <unk> marshland .
“ Don ’ t look at them , ” warned Lucian .
His warning came too late for one man and his wife .
Miss Fortune didn ’ t know their names , but knew they had lost a son to <unk> less than a year ago .
They walked from the cliffs following a vision in the lights only they could see .
Another man took his hooked hand to his throat before his friends could stop him .
Another simply vanished into the mist without anyone seeing him go .
By the time they reached Serpent Bridge , their company <unk> less than a dozen .
Miss Fortune couldn ’ t feel sorry for them , she ’ d told them not to come with her .
If they ’ d wanted to live forever , they should be shuttered behind closed doors and protective carvings , clutching spiral talismans of the Bearded Lady and <unk> to whatever gave them <unk> .
But against the Harrowing , even that was no guarantee of safety .
They ’ d passed countless homes smashed open with splintered shutters and doors hanging <unk> from leather hinges .
Miss Fortune kept her eyes fixed forward , but it was impossible not to feel the accusing gazes from the frozen faces within or sense the terror of their last moments .
“ The Black Mist will have its due , ” said Rafen as they passed yet another charnel house , the families within cold and dead .
She wanted to be angry at such <unk> of horror , but what good would that do ?
After all , he was right .
Instead , she focused on the <unk> outline of the structure across the bridge .
It sat in the center of a gouged crater in the cliff , as if some mighty sea creature had taken a vast bite from the rock .
Like most places in Bilgewater it was <unk> from the ocean ’ s <unk> .
Its walls were driftwood and branches from faraway lands , its windows the scavenged remains of ships swept up from the seabed .
It had a <unk> quality of possessing not a single straight line anywhere in its <unk> .
The curious <unk> gave it a sense of being somehow in motion , as if it might one day choose another place to set down temporary roots .
Its <unk> was <unk> crooked , <unk> like the horn of a <unk> and <unk> with the same spiral symbol Miss Fortune wore around her neck .
A shimmering light wreathed the <unk> , and where it shone the darkness was held in <unk> .
“ What is that place ? ” asked Lucian .
“ The <unk> of the Bearded Lady , ” she said .
“ The House of Nagakabouros . ” “ Is it safe ? ” “ It ’ s better than staying out here . ” Lucian nodded and they set off across the winding length of the bridge .
Like the temple it approached , the bridge was an <unk> thing , its cobbles undulant like something alive .
Rafen paused at the crumbling parapet and looked down .
“ Getting higher every year , ” he said .
Reluctantly , Miss Fortune joined him and looked over the edge .
The docks and Rat Town were <unk> beneath the Black Mist , and even the web of gun ’ <unk> was barely visible .
Bilgewater was choking in the grip of the mist , its tendrils <unk> ever deeper into the city .
Screams of terror drifted upwards , each one a life ended and a fresh soul for the legion of the dead .
Rafen shrugged .
“ A few years from now there won ’ t be anywhere in Bilgewater beyond its reach . ” “ A lot can happen in a few years , ” said Miss Fortune .
“ This happens every year ? ” asked Olaf , one foot perched on the parapet with a reckless disregard for the dizzying drop .
Miss Fortune nodded .
“ <unk> , ” said the Freljordian .
“ If I am fated not to die this night , I will return here when the Black Mist rises again . ” “ It ’ s your funeral , ” replied Rafen .
“ Thank you , ” said Olaf , slapping an enormous palm on Rafen ’ s back , almost knocking him from the bridge .
The Freljordian ’ s eyes widened as a host of ghostly tentacles rose from the mist , <unk> to <unk> down on the dwellings of Rat Town .
“ The beast ! ” he cried .
And before anyone could stop him , he vaulted onto the parapet and hurled himself from the edge .
“ <unk> bastard , ” said Rafen as Olaf ’ s dwindling form vanished into the mist below .
“ All the <unk> are mad , ” said Miss Fortune .
“ But he was <unk> than most I ’ ve met . ” “ Get everyone inside , ” said Lucian .
She heard the <unk> in his voice and turned to see him facing a towering figure in <unk> black robes hung with hooked chains .
<unk> green light wreathed the specter as it lifted a swaying lantern in one <unk> hand .
Fear touched Miss Fortune , fear like nothing she ’ d known since she ’ d watched her mother die and stared down the barrel of the killer ’ s gun .
Lucian drew his pistols .
“ Thresh is mine . ” “ He ’ s all yours , ” she said , and turned away .
Her gaze was drawn upwards as shadows closed around the temple .
The breath caught in her throat as she saw Hecarim and his death knights at the crater ’ s ridge .
The Shadow of War raised his fiery glaive and the ghostly horsemen urged their <unk> downward .
No mortal rider could make that descent , but these were riders of death .
“ Run ! ” shouted Miss Fortune .
<unk> <unk> SHADOW AND FORTUNE BY GRAHAM MCNEILL SHADOW AND FORTUNE BY GRAHAM MCNEILL The end of the bridge thickened with noxious green light .
The Chain Warden hid his corpse features beneath a rotted hood , but the light of his lantern hinted at the remains of ravaged flesh , gaunt and drained of all emotion , save <unk> <unk> .
He moved softly , like all his kind .
<unk> moans sighed from his robes as he moved .
Thresh lifted his head a fraction , and Lucian saw the <unk> of <unk> teeth widen in a grin of anticipation .
“ <unk> , ” said Thresh , rolling the word around his mouth like a <unk> .
Lucian knelt , <unk> the <unk> of clarity to steel his soul for the battle to come .
He had prepared for this moment a thousand times , and now that it was here , his mouth was dry , his palms slick with sweat .
“ You murdered Senna , ” he said , standing and lifting his head .
“ The only person I had left in the world . ” “ Senna ... ? ” said Thresh , the sound wet and gurgling , as though squeezed from a throat once crushed by a <unk> ’ s <unk> .
“ My wife , ” said Lucian , knowing he should not speak , that every word was a weapon the wraith would turn against him .
Tears blurred his vision as grief washed away every <unk> and every shred of <unk> .
He lifted the silver locket from around his neck and snapped it open , needing the wraith to understand the depth of all he had lost .
Thresh grinned , his needle teeth glinting as he tapped the glass of the lantern with a yellowed nail .
“ I remember her , ” he said .
“ A vital soul .
Not yet <unk> and cold .
<unk> for torment .
Hope for a new life .
It bloomed in her , you know .
<unk> , new , like a spring flower .
All too easy to pluck and ruin those with dreams . ” Lucian lifted his pistols .
“ If you remember her , then you will remember these , ” he said .
The <unk> grin never <unk> beneath the ragged cowl .
“ The weapons of light , ” he said .
“ And light is ever the bane of darkness , ” said Lucian , channeling every scrap of hatred into his relic pistols .
“ Wait , ” said Thresh , but Lucian was done waiting .
He loosed a pair of blinding shots .
A <unk> of <unk> fire engulfed the Chain Warden and his howls were music to Lucian ’ s ears .
Then the howls changed to gurgling laughter .
A <unk> of dark light faded around Thresh , drawn back into his lantern and leaving him utterly untouched by the fire .
Lucian fired again , a storm of radiant bolts , each perfectly <unk> , but every one wasted .
Each shot dissipated harmlessly against a shimmering haze of dark energy from the lantern .
“ Yes , I remember those weapons , ” said the wraith .
“ I tore their secrets from her mind . ” Lucian froze .
“ What did you just say ? ” Thresh laughed , a <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
“ You don ’ t know ?
After all the reborn order learned of me , you never once suspected ? ” Lucian felt cold dread settle in his belly .
A horror he had never acknowledged for fear he would go insane .
“ She did not die , ” continued Thresh , holding up his lantern .
Lucian saw tortured spirits twisting in its depths .
Thresh grinned .
“ I ripped her soul out and kept it . ” “ No ... ” said Lucian .
“ I saw her die . ” “ She screams still inside my lantern , ” said Thresh , drifting closer with every <unk> word .
“ Her every moment of existence is sweet agony .
<unk> ... can you hear her ? ” “ No , ” sobbed Lucian , his relic pistols falling to the stones of the bridge .
Thresh circled him , chains <unk> from his leather belt and <unk> over Lucian ’ s body .
The hooks cut into his storm coat , seeking the soft flesh beneath .
“ Hope was her weakness .
Love her <unk> . ” Lucian looked up into Thresh ’ s ravaged features .
His eyes were voids , dark holes into emptiness .
Whatever Thresh had been in life , nothing now remained .
No compassion , no mercy and no humanity .
“ All is death and suffering , mortal , ” said the Chain Warden , reaching for Lucian ’ s neck .
“ No matter where you run , your only true legacy is death .
But before then , there is me . ” The breath hammered in Miss Fortune ’ s throat as she ran for the temple .
Her lungs fought to draw breath , and her veins felt <unk> with ice .
Coils of <unk> mist reached up to the rock of the temple , drawn by the presence of the two lords of the unliving .
<unk> flashes of light flared behind her , but she didn ’ t look back .
She heard the thunder of <unk> beats on rock , seeing sparks above them in the darkness .
She imagined the breath of ghostly steeds on her neck .
The space between her shoulder blades burned hot where she expected the stabbing thrust of a spectral lance .
Wait , how can they make sparks when they ’ re ghosts ?
The absurdity of the thought made her laugh , and she was still laughing as she slammed into the warped timber doors of the temple .
Rafen and her ragged band were already there , hammering fists and palms against the door .
“ In the name of the Bearded Lady , let us in ! ” he yelled .
He looked up as Miss Fortune joined him .
“ The doors are shut , ” he said .
“ I noticed , ” she gasped , wrenching the pendant Illaoi had given her .
She placed her palm flat on door , with the coral pressed hard against the wood .
“ Illaoi ! ” she shouted .
“ I ’ m ready to stamp on that damn eel ’ s neck .
Now open the bloody door ! ” “ <unk> ? ” said Rafen .
“ What eel ?
What are you talking about ? ” “ Never mind , ” she snapped , <unk> her palm bloody against the wood .
“ I think it was a <unk> . ” The door swung outwards as if it had been <unk> the whole time .
Miss Fortune stepped back to allow her fighters inside first , and finally turned around .
Hecarim reared up and swung his fiery glaive for her skull .
A hand <unk> her collar and hauled her backward .
The tip of the weapon sliced an inch from her throat .
She fell hard on her <unk> .
Illaoi stood in the doorway , holding her stone idol out before her like a shield .
White mist clung to it like corposant .
“ The dead are not welcome here , ” she said .
Rafen and the others hauled the door shut and dropped a heavy spar of seasoned oak into place on the rusted <unk> to either side .
A huge impact slammed into the door .
Wood split and splinters flew .
Illaoi turned and walked past Miss Fortune , still sprawled on a <unk> floor of <unk> and clay fragments .
“ You took your sweet time , girl , ” she said as Miss Fortune climbed to her feet .
The temple was filled with at least two hundred people , maybe more .
She saw a wide cross section of Bilgewater ’ s <unk> : its native <unk> , pirates , traders and <unk> <unk> , together with <unk> unlucky or <unk> enough to seek a <unk> so close to the Harrowing .
“ Is that door going to hold ? ” she asked .
“ It will or it won ’ t , ” said Illaoi , heading towards a <unk> statue at the <unk> of the temple .
Miss Fortune tried to make sense of it , but gave up when her eye kept getting lost in the many spirals and looping curves .
“ That ’ s not an answer . ” “ It ’ s the only one I have , ” said Illaoi , setting her idol in a <unk> <unk> in the statue .
She began moving in a circle around the statue , beating a rhythmic pattern on her <unk> and chest with her fists .
The people in the temple joined her circling , beating palms against bare skin , <unk> their feet and speaking in a language she didn ’ t understand .
“ What are they doing ? ” “ <unk> some motion back to the world , ” said Illaoi .
“ But we will need time . ” “ You ’ ll have it , ” promised Miss Fortune .
Lucian felt the spectral hooks bite deep into his flesh , colder than northern ice and twice as painful .
The Chain Warden ’ s hand closed on his throat and his skin burned at the wraith ’ s touch .
He felt his strength drawn from him , the <unk> of his heart slow .
Thresh lifted him from the ground and held his lantern aloft , ready to receive his soul .
The <unk> lights within swirled in agitation , ghostly faces and hands pressing against the glass from within .
“ Long I have sought your soul , shadow hunter , ” said Thresh .
“ But only now is it ripe for the taking . ” Lucian ’ s vision greyed at the edges , feeling his soul <unk> away from his bones .
He fought to hold on , but the Chain Warden had been <unk> souls for countless lifetimes and knew his craft better than any .
“ <unk> harder , ” said Thresh with monstrous appetite .
“ Your soul burns brighter when you fight . ” Lucian tried to speak , but no words came out , just a soft stream of warm breath that carried his soul .
A glittering scythe floated in the air above Lucian , a <unk> reaper of souls .
Its blade shivered with anticipation .
Lucian ... That voice .
Her voice .
My love ...
The <unk> of Thresh ’ s blade turned , <unk> to better part soul from flesh .
Lucian drew back his breath as he saw a face resolve in the glass of the lantern .
One among countless thousands , but one with more reason than any to push herself to the fore .
Full lips , wide , almond shaped eyes , imploring him to live .
“ Senna ... ” gasped Lucian .
Let me be your shield .
He knew what she meant in a heartbeat .
The <unk> between them was as strong as it had been when they hunted the creatures of shadow side by side .
With the last of his strength , Lucian reached up and snapped the locket from around his neck .
The chain glittered silver in the moonlight .
The Chain Warden saw something was amiss and hissed in anger .
Lucian was faster .
He spun the chain like a <unk> , but instead of <unk> a lead bullet , he lashed it around the arm holding the lantern .
Before Thresh could shake it off , Lucian drew the silver awl from its sheath in his long coat and plunged it into the specter ’ s wrist .
The Chain Warden screeched in pain , a sensation he had likely not felt in millennia .
He dropped Lucian and thrashed in agony as the myriad souls trapped in his lantern suddenly found a means to strike back at their <unk> .
Lucian felt his soul snap back into his body and drew in heaving <unk> of air , like a drowning man breaking the surface .
Hurry , my love .
He is too strong ... His sight returned , <unk> than ever before .
Lucian snatched his pistols from the ground .
He caught the briefest glimpse of Senna ’ s face in the lantern and etched it on his heart .
Never again would her face grow dim in his memories .
“ Thresh , ” he said , aiming his twin pistols .
The Chain Warden looked up , the voids of his eyes alight with <unk> at the defiance of his captive souls .
He held Lucian ’ s gaze and extended his lantern , but the <unk> souls had <unk> whatever <unk> it once offered .
Lucian fired a blistering series of perfect shots .
They burned through the Chain Warden ’ s ghostly robes and ignited his spirit form in a searing <unk> of light .
Lucian marched towards Thresh , his twin weapons blazing .
<unk> in agony , the Chain Warden <unk> from Lucian ’ s unending <unk> , his <unk> now powerless to resist these weapons of ancient power .
“ Death is here for you , ” said Lucian .
“ Embrace it , safe in the knowledge I will ensure it is final . ” Thresh gave one last howl before leaping from the bridge , falling like a burning <unk> to the city below .
Lucian watched him fall until the Black Mist swallowed him .
He slumped to his knees .
“ Thank you , my love , ” said Lucian .
“ My light . ” The temple walls shook with the violence of the assault .
Black mist <unk> between <unk> planks and through cracks in the scavenged glass of the windows .
The door shuddered in its frame .
<unk> claws of mist tore at the wood .
Screams echoed as a howling gale battered the <unk> timbers of the roof .
“ Over there ! ” shouted Miss Fortune as a host of <unk> with burning red eyes poured through a broken section of wall that had once been a series of <unk> from Ionia .
She leapt into the midst of the wraiths .
It felt like jumping naked into an ice hole cut in a <unk> .
Even the <unk> touch of the dead leeched warmth and life .
The coral pendant burned hot against her skin .
She slashed her looted sword through the creatures and felt the same bite she ’ d felt before .
Her bullets might be useless against the dead , but this Demacian blade hurt them .
They fell back from her , screeching and hissing .
Could the dead know fear ?
It seemed they could , for they fled the sword ’ s glittering edge .
She didn ’ t let them go , stabbing and slashing the mist wherever it poured in .
“ That ’ s it !
Run ! ” she yelled .
A child screamed and Miss Fortune <unk> over as the mist reached to claim him .
She dived and snatched the boy in her arms before rolling to safety .
<unk> claws plunged into her back , and Miss Fortune gasped as numbing cold spread through her limbs .
She stabbed behind her and something dead howled .
A woman sheltering behind an overturned pew reached for the boy and Miss Fortune let him <unk> to safety .
She pushed herself to her feet , weakness spreading through her body like a <unk> infection .
Everywhere was <unk> and clashing steel , deathly howls and screams of terror .
“ Sarah ! ” shouted Rafen .
She looked up to see the <unk> locking bar securing the door split along its length .
Rafen and a dozen men had their backs braced against the <unk> assault , but the doors were <unk> inwards .
<unk> spread and grasping hands of mist reached inside .
A man was snatched backwards and his piteous screams were abruptly cut off as he vanished into the mist .
Another had his arm ripped off as he reached to help him .
Rafen spun and rammed his dagger through the gap .
<unk> hands tore the useless weapon from his hand .
A howling body pushed itself in through the disintegrating door and plunged its hands into Rafen ’ s chest .
Her second in command roared in pain , his face draining of color .
She staggered over to him , her strength all but gone .
Her blade <unk> through spectral arms , and the creature shrieked as it vanished .
Rafen fell into her , and they collapsed back into the <unk> together .
Rafen gasped for breath , his features as slack as hers .
“ Don ’ t you die on me , Rafen ! ” she wheezed .
“ It ’ ll take more than the dead to kill me , ” he grunted .
“ <unk> thing just <unk> me . ” <unk> broke somewhere up above .
Coils of black mist <unk> overhead , a boiling mass of snapping teeth , claws and hungry eyes .
Miss Fortune tried to get to her feet , but her limbs burned with exhaustion .
She ground her teeth in frustration .
<unk> a handful of her company remained , and the people sheltering in here weren ’ t fighters .
The dead were getting in .
Miss Fortune looked back at Illaoi .
The priestess was surrounded by her people , all of them still circling the statue and <unk> their <unk> , <unk> ritual .
It didn ’ t appear to be <unk> anything .
The strange statue remained unmoving and <unk> .
What had she expected , that it would come to life and drive the dead back like some clanking iron <unk> from <unk> ?
“ Whatever it is you ’ re doing , do it faster ! ” shouted Miss Fortune .
A section of the roof ripped loose and spun off into the tempest surrounding the temple .
A swirling <unk> of spirits boiled inside and touched down like a <unk> .
Wraiths and things that defied understanding spun from the unliving <unk> to fall upon the living .
Finally the door gave out and exploded inwards , the timbers dry and rotted by the touch of the dead .
The <unk> <unk> of a hunting horn filled the temple , and Miss Fortune ’ s hands flew to her ears at its deafening echoes .
Hecarim rode into the temple , <unk> the men who ’ d been bracing the door with their bodies .
Their souls were drawn up into the Shadow of War ’ s <unk> glaive , and the cold fire of its edge illuminated the temple with <unk> radiance .
His death knights rode at his back , and the spirits already within the temple drew back in recognition of Hecarim ’ s terrible glory .
“ I said the dead are not welcome here , ” boomed Illaoi .
Miss Fortune looked up to see the priestess towering over her , <unk> and majestic .
<unk> light clung to her limbs and <unk> on the stone <unk> she held in trembling hands .
Veins stood out like <unk> on her neck , and her jawline was taut with effort .
<unk> ran in <unk> down her face .
Whatever Illaoi was doing was <unk> her <unk> .
“ These mortal souls are mine , ” said Hecarim , and Miss Fortune felt herself recoil from the iron syllables of his voice .
“ They are not , ” said Illaoi .
“ This is the house of Nagakabouros , who stands in <unk> to the dead . ” “ The dead will have their due , ” said Hecarim , lowering his glaive to point at Illaoi ’ s heart .
The priestess shook her head .
“ Not today , ” she said .
“ Not while I still move . ” “ You cannot stop me . ” “ <unk> as well as dead , ” grinned Illaoi as a swelling radiance built behind her .
“ I didn ’ t say I was going to stop you . ” Miss Fortune turned and saw the spiraling statue bathed in blinding radiance .
White light <unk> from its <unk> , and shadows fled from its touch .
She <unk> her eyes as the light <unk> outwards like writhing tentacles and where it met the Black Mist it stripped it bare , exposing the twisted souls within .
The sinuous light pulled the dead onwards , <unk> the <unk> magic that cursed them to <unk> so very long ago .
She expected screams , but instead the <unk> dead wept with joy as their souls were freed to move on .
The light spread over the cracked walls of the temple , and as it touched her , Miss Fortune cried out as the deathly numbness in her flesh was banished in a rush of heat and life .
The light of Nagakabouros closed on Hecarim , and Miss Fortune saw his fear at the thought of what transformations it might work upon him .
What could be so awful that it was better to remain cursed ?
“ You can be free , Hecarim , ” said Illaoi , her voice <unk> to the <unk> of endurance by what she had unleashed .
“ You can move on , live in the light as the man you always <unk> of being before his grief and folly remade you . ” Hecarim roared and swept his glaive at Illaoi ’ s neck .
Miss Fortune ’ s blade <unk> it in a clashing flare of sparks .
She shook her head .
“ Get out of my city , ” she said .
Hecarim ’ s blade drew back for another strike , but before the blow could land , the light finally pierced his veil of darkness .
He bellowed in pain and fell back from its burning touch .
The dark rider ’ s outline shimmered , like two picture box <unk> wavering in candlelight on the same <unk> .
Miss Fortune caught a fleeting glimpse of a tall rider , armored in silver and gold .
A young man , handsome and proud with dark eyes and a future of glory ahead of him .
What happened to him ?
Hecarim roared and galloped from the temple .
His death knights and the darkness went with him , a <unk> host of tattered spirits following in their wake .
The light of Nagakabouros spread over Bilgewater like the coming dawn .
None who saw it could ever remember so sweet a sight ; the first rays of sunlight after a storm , the first hint of warmth after a bitter winter .
The Black Mist withdrew before it , roiling in a churning maelstrom of panicked spirits .
The dead turned on one another in a <unk> , some fighting to return from whence they had come as others <unk> sought out the light ’ s release .
Silence fell as the Black Mist drew back over the ocean , drawn to the cursed island where it claimed <unk> .
True dawn broke over the eastern horizon , and a <unk> wind blew through the city as the people of Bilgewater let out a <unk> breath .
The Harrowing was over .
Silence filled the temple ; the utter lack of sound a <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of moments ago .
“ It ’ s done , ” said Miss Fortune .
“ Until the next time , ” said Illaoi <unk> .
“ The Black Mist ’ s hunger burns like a sickness . ” “ What did you do ? ” “ What I had to . ” “ Whatever it was , I thank you . ” Illaoi shook her head and put a powerful arm around Miss Fortune ’ s shoulder .
“ Thank the goddess , ” said Illaoi .
“ Make an offering .
Something big . ” “ I will , ” said Miss Fortune .
“ You better .
My god <unk> empty promises . ” The veiled threat <unk> , and for a moment she thought of putting a bullet through the priestess ’ skull .
Before she could do more than inch her hand to her pistols , Illaoi crumpled like a ripped <unk> .
Miss Fortune grabbed for her , but the priestess was too enormous to hold upright alone .
They went to the seashell floor together .
“ Rafen , help me get her up , ” she said .
Together they <unk> Illaoi up against a broken pew , grunting with the effort of shifting her colossal bulk .
“ The Bearded Lady rose from the sea ... ” said Rafen .
“ Don ’ t be stupid all your life , ” said Illaoi .
“ I said Nagakabouros doesn ’ t live under the sea . ” “ So where does she live ? ” asked Rafen .
“ In the sky ? ” Illaoi shook her head and punched him in the heart .
Rafen grunted and winced in pain .
“ There is where you find her . ” Illaoi grinned at the <unk> of her answer and her eyes drifted closed .
“ Is she dead ? ” asked Rafen , <unk> his bruised chest .
Illaoi reached up and <unk> him .
Then started <unk> like a <unk> with <unk> .
Lucian sat on the edge of the bridge and watched the city <unk> from Black Mist .
He ’ d hated Bilgewater on first sight , but there was a quality of beauty to it as the sunlight bathed its myriad <unk> roofs in a warm amber glow .
A city reborn , like it was every time the Harrowing receded .
An <unk> name for this dread moment , but one that carried only a fraction of the sorrow of its <unk> .
Did anyone here really understand the real tragedy of the Shadow Isles ?
And even if they did , would they care ?
He turned as he heard footsteps approaching .
“ It ’ s kind of pretty from up here , ” said Miss Fortune .
“ But only from up here . ” “ Yes , it ’ s a <unk> ’ s nest alright , ” said Miss Fortune .
“ There ’ s good people and bad people , but I ’ ve been making sure there ’ s a lot less of the bad . ” “ The way I hear it , you started a war , ” said Lucian .
“ Some might say that ’ s like burning down your house to kill a rat . ” He saw anger touch her , but it passed quickly .
“ I thought I was making things better for everyone , ” she said , <unk> the parapet , “ but they ’ re only getting worse .
I need to do something about that , starting now . ” “ Is that why you were out in the Black Mist ? ” The woman thought for a moment .
“ Maybe not at first , ” she said .
“ I let a razor-eel off the hook when I killed Gangplank , and if I don ’ t take hold of it and get it back on , it ’ s going to bite a lot of the good people . ” “ A razor-eel ? ” “ What I mean to say is that when I brought the <unk> King down , I had no idea what would happen when he was gone .
I didn ’ t much care , ” she said .
“ But I ’ ve seen what ’ s happening down there without someone in control .
The city ’ s tearing its own throat out .
Bilgewater needs someone strong at the top .
No reason that someone can ’ t be me .
The war ’ s just starting , and the only way it ’ ll end quickly is if I win it . ” The silence between them stretched .
“ My answer is no . ” “ I didn ’ t ask anything . ” “ You ’ re going to , ” said Lucian .
“ You want me to stay and help you win your war , but I can ’ t .
Your fight isn ’ t my fight . ” “ It could be , ” said Miss Fortune .
“ The pay ’ s good and you ’ d get to kill a lot of bad people .
And save a lot of innocent souls . ” “ There is only one soul I need to save , ” said Lucian .
“ And I won ’ t save it in Bilgewater . ” Miss Fortune nodded and held out her hand .
“ Then I ’ ll say <unk> and good hunting , ” she said , standing and dusting her <unk> .
“ I hope you find what you ’ re looking for .
Just know that you can lose yourself to revenge . ” Lucian watched her limp back to the sagging ruins of the temple as the survivors within emerged , <unk> , into the <unk> .
She thought she understood what drove him , but she hadn ’ t the first <unk> .
Vengeance ?
He was far beyond vengeance .
His beloved was held in torment by an undying wraith , a creature from ancient days that understood suffering like no other .
Miss Fortune did not understand even a fraction of his pain .
He rose and lifted his gaze out to sea .
The ocean was calm now , an emerald green expanse .
People were already moving down on the docks , <unk> ships and <unk> their homes .
Bilgewater never stopped , even in the <unk> of the Harrowing .
He scanned the forest of swaying masts , looking for a ship that wasn ’ t too badly <unk> .
Perhaps one desperate captain could be <unk> to take him where he needed to go .
“ I am coming , my light , ” he said .
“ And I will free you . ” The fisherman grunted as he worked the <unk> to haul the big man from the water and onto his boat .
The rope was frayed and he <unk> in the cold air as he worked the <unk> .
“ By the bristles of her bearded chin , you ’ re a big bastard , right sure ye are , ” he said , <unk> the big man ’ s armor with a <unk> hook and pulling him around over the rolling deck .
He kept a wary eye out for <unk> , above and below the surface .
No sooner had the Black Mist <unk> over the horizon than <unk> of boats put out to sea .
The waters were <unk> with <unk> , and if you weren ’ t fast , you ended up with nothing .
He ’ d spotted the floating man first and had already fought off six <unk> trying to reach him .
<unk> if <unk> like them were going to steal this ocean bounty from him .
The big man had been drifting on a bed of what looked like the remains of a giant Krakenwyrm .
Its tentacles were pulped and bloated with noxious <unk> , which was all that had kept the big man ’ s armored form afloat .
He dropped his catch to the deck and laid him out along the gunwale before casting an <unk> eye over his body .
A heavy iron hauberk of ring and scale , <unk> , <unk> boots and , best of all , a magnificent axe tangled in the straps of his armor .
“ Oh , yes , make a few Krakens out of you , me beauty , ” he said , dancing a happy jig around his boat .
“ A few Krakens indeed ! ” The big man <unk> up <unk> <unk> .
“ <unk> I still alive ? ” he asked .
The fisherman stopped his happy jig and slid a hand towards the long knife at his belt .
He used it to open fish <unk> .
No reason he couldn ’ t use it to open a throat .
<unk> ’ t be the first time a <unk> had helped someone on their way to the Bearded Lady to claim a prize .
The big man opened his eyes .
“ <unk> that knife again and I ’ ll cut you into more pieces than that damned Krakenwyrm . ” = = = = = = <unk> = = = = = = = = UNKNOWN = = The sword-wife stood amid the burnt out ruin of her home .
Everything and everyone that mattered to her was gone , and she was filled with fathomless grief ... and hate .
<unk> was now all that compelled her .
She saw again the smile on his face as he gave the order .
He was meant to be their <unk> , but he ’ d spat upon his vows .
<unk> was not the only family shattered by the <unk> .
The desire to go after him was strong .
She wanted nothing more than to plant her sword in his chest and watch the life <unk> from his eyes ... but she knew she would never be able to get close enough to him .
He was <unk> day and night , and she was but one warrior .
She would never be able to fight her way through his <unk> alone .
Such a death would serve no purpose .
She took a shuddering breath , knowing there was no coming back .
A crude <unk> of a man , formed of <unk> and twine , lay upon a <unk> dresser .
Its body was wrapped in a scrap of cloth torn from the cloak of the betrayer .
She ’ d <unk> it from her husband ’ s dead grasp .
<unk> it was a hammer and three rusted nails .
She gathered everything up and moved to the threshold .
The door itself was gone , smashed to splinters in the attack .
Beyond , lit by moonlight , lay the empty , darkened fields .
Reaching up , the sword-wife pressed the <unk> to the hardwood <unk> .
“ I <unk> <unk> , Lady of Vengeance , ” she said , her voice low , trembling with the depth of her fury .
“ From beyond the veil , hear my plea .
Come forth .
Let justice be done . ” She readied her hammer and the first of the nails .
“ I name my betrayer once , ” she said , and spoke his name aloud .
As she did so , she placed the tip of the first nail to the chest of the <unk> .
With a single strike , she hammered it in deep , pinning it to the hardwood door frame .
The sword-wife shivered .
The room had become <unk> colder .
Or had she imagined it ?
“ I name him twice , ” she said , and she did so , hammering the second nail alongside the first .
Her gaze dropped , and she jolted in shock .
A dark figure stood out in the moonlit field , a hundred <unk> in the distance .
It was utterly motionless .
Breathing quicker , the sword-wife returned her attention to the unfinished task .
“ I name him <unk> , ” she said , speaking again the name of the murderer of her husband and children , before hammering home the final nail .
An ancient spirit of vengeance stood before her , filling the doorway , and the sword-wife staggered back , gasping <unk> .
The otherworldly being was clad in archaic armor , her flesh translucent and glowing with spectral <unk> .
Black Mist coiled around her like a living shroud .
With a <unk> of tortured metal , the spectral figure drew forth the blackened spear protruding from her breastplate — the ancient weapon that had ended her life .
She threw it to the ground before the sword-wife .
No words were spoken ; there was no need .
The sword-wife knew what was being offered to her — vengeance — and knew its terrible cost : her soul .
The spirit watched on , her face impassive and her eyes burning with an unrelenting cold fury , as the sword-wife picked up the treacherous weapon .
“ I pledge myself to vengeance , ” said the sword-wife , her voice quivering .
She reversed the spear , aiming the tip inward , towards her heart .
“ I pledge it with my blood .
I pledge it with my soul . ” She paused .
Her husband would have pleaded for her to turn away from this path .
He would have begged her not to <unk> her soul for <unk> .
A moment of doubt gnawed at her .
The undying specter watched on .
The sword-wife ’ s eyes narrowed as she thought of her husband lying dead , cut down by swords and axes .
She thought again of her children , sprawled upon the ground , and her resolve hardened like a cold stone in her heart .
Her grip tightened upon the spear .
“ Help me , ” she <unk> , her decision made .
“ Please , help me kill him . ” She rammed the spear into her chest , driving it in deep .
The sword-wife ’ s eyes widened and she dropped to her knees .
She tried to speak , but only blood bubbled from her lips .
The ghostly apparition watched her die , her expression impassive .
As the last of the <unk> ran from her body , the shade of the sword-wife climbed to her feet .
She looked down at her insubstantial hands in wonder , then at her own corpse lying <unk> in a growing pool of blood upon the floor .
The shade ’ s expression hardened , and a ghostly sword appeared in her hand .
An ethereal <unk> , little more than a wisp of light , <unk> the newly formed shade to the avenging spirit she had <unk> .
Through their bond , the sword-wife saw her <unk> , <unk> the noble warrior she had been in life : tall and proud , her armor gleaming .
Her posture was confident , yet without arrogance ; a born leader , a born soldier .
This was a <unk> the sword-wife would have willingly bled for .
Behind the spirit ’ s anger , she sensed her <unk> — recognition of their shared pain of betrayal .
“ Your cause is our cause , ” said Kalista , the Spear of Vengeance .
Her voice was grave cold .
“ We walk the path of vengeance as one , now . ” The sword-wife nodded .
With that , the avenging spirit and the shade of the sword-wife stepped into the darkness and were gone .
= = = = = = IN <unk> OF <unk> = = = = = = = = <unk> <unk> . <unk> = = The waters were <unk> still at night .
Their surface was so undisturbed , one might mistake it for dark glass <unk> the <unk> skies above .
<unk> bathed everything in cold , silver light , though its radiance was slowly dying .
The moon was being <unk> .
The sky between it and those who looked upon its beauty had been <unk> by <unk> tendrils of shadow that <unk> across the night like living , <unk> storms .
Their like had been seen many times before , and many were the souls carried off within them into fathomless torment , but never had they grown so large , or reached so far .
For all their horror , the world had grown used to Harrowings , <unk> of darkness teeming with monstrous wraiths that <unk> from the <unk> Shadow Isles .
Those in their path learned how to watch for the signs , how to survive their wailing fury , and how to mourn those taken by them .
But what was happening now , what was reaching up to swallow the sky , was something different .
<unk> like there was some unseen hand <unk> it .
Tonight , though , one could still glimpse the world and the stillness of the sea .
Tonight , its <unk> was marred only by tiny islands of splintered wood , torn cloth , and the bobbing forms of the newly dead .
Tudre tried not to look at them .
In the first hours after their doomed flight and the desperate struggle to abandon the ship , he had screamed himself <unk> , calling out in hope that anyone else might have survived .
But it was in <unk> .
He was alone .
And so Tudre <unk> his remaining strength to cling to a hunk of driftwood , and resist the icy waters seeking to carry him down to their lightless depths .
He could almost hear the deep calling up to him to join all the others , her silver tongue carrying the promise of sleep , if he would just draw her water into his lungs .
The sea had numbed his legs , but Tudre <unk> himself to move them .
He shut out the <unk> call of despair that <unk> at his boots with the gentle <unk> of death .
Tudre had not reached this far in life through <unk> , and he would not start now .
He just had to get to land .
Tudre had sailed with all speed to make for <unk> , a small island off the Valoran mainland .
They had gotten so close — it couldn ’ t be far .
Though exhaustion and the cold blurred his vision , Tudre caught movement out of the corner of his good eye .
He focused , revealing it to be a scrap of oiled <unk> drifting close to the splintered sanctuary he held fast to .
Tudre peered at it .
The marks and ink on its surface were marred and <unk> by water , yet still <unk> .
It was a piece of their <unk> <unk> .
<unk> onto it was a rough , <unk> map of trade and <unk> routes and <unk> of <unk> distance .
The names of known places , and even a few secret ones .
<unk> <unk> of clouds with faces , breathing out <unk> from between their lips to mark the best <unk> where the winds might <unk> a ship with speedy passage , for those who dared — “ You ’ re insane . ” Tudre snorted , reaching up to catch the swinging lantern that was the cabin ’ s sole source of light .
The seas were getting <unk> , and he had no time to suffer his quartermaster ’ s <unk> .
“ <unk> ’ soft in yer old age , Mister Bowsy ? ” Tudre grinned his big , cunning grin as he baited the old corsair next to him .
“ No shame if ye are .
<unk> ’ can tell me , though do me a kindness and say so now .
I would need someone else in your spot , to keep the crew in line . ” “ I ain ’ t scared . ” Bowsy steadied himself to spit a wad of <unk> onto the deck through the gap made by a missing tooth .
“ But I see sense .
This ’ ll get us killed , <unk> .
And I ain ’ t the only one who thinks so . ” “ We go fast , we get <unk> . ” Tudre stabbed a finger down at the old map set on the table before them .
He swept aside a tiny <unk> that had collected on it from a <unk> above their heads , and then traced a route <unk> in dull red ink .
“ Every other ship around is <unk> , <unk> <unk> ’ like they be back on dear ol ’ <unk> ’ s <unk> .
But <unk> <unk> ’ er <unk> , Mister Bowsy .
<unk> on what ’ s <unk> ’ out there , <unk> !
We make a run , we can get what they ’ re all too <unk> to collect . ” “ They ’ re tied to dock because it ’ s a damn Harrowing . ” Bowsy crossed his thick , tattooed arms over his chest .
“ <unk> anyone ’ s seen , mind you , even the <unk> ones .
Whatever ’ s out there ain ’ t worth <unk> ’ swept up in that , I ’ m <unk> ’ ya ! ” Tudre <unk> , finding some of the red ink had come off the map to <unk> his finger .
He stared his quartermaster in the eye .
His voice dropped , settling into the colder tone that meant the discussion had run its course .
“ Anyone wants out can go , no <unk> .
<unk> hands means a greater stake for those with the grit to be going out .
And we are going out , make no mistake . ” Bowsy tried , one last time .
“ At least let it be put to a <unk> .
Let the crew have their say in it . ” “ Not this time . ” Tudre ’ s good eye bored into the quartermaster , unyielding .
Bowsy held his gaze for a moment that stretched into another , but no further .
He looked away .
“ Now . ” Tudre ’ s grin returned , full and cunning .
“ You in or not ? ” <unk> his head , Tudre tried to <unk> the memory from his mind , but the effort left him dizzy .
The unwelcome <unk> held fast despite his efforts , clinging behind his eyes like <unk> .
Or as though something was holding it there , forcing him to see .
He felt a strangeness fall over him then , almost like mist curling up off the water .
A sailor ’ s life was <unk> with <unk> and ill <unk> , gut feelings and lucky <unk> .
Tudre had long become <unk> to a world that existed side by side with his own , and every now and then the walls between them thinned .
It was happening to him now , like a dull <unk> .
An <unk> sense of dread and anger , seeking to work guilt into his bones .
But he ’ d have none of it .
“ <unk> ’ s made <unk> <unk> ’ , ask any man , ” Tudre wheezed through <unk> teeth .
“ I done that run dozens o ’ times .
See a chance at fortune , ya take it .
Can ’ t live this life if ye ain ’ t the <unk> ’ sort ! ” Tudre ’ s words bore the <unk> bravado he had carried so well in his life , a bounty of natural grit and <unk> that had seen him not only rise to captain his own ship , but keep it .
The high seas were <unk> to the weak , as was Bilgewater and any big port whose doors he had ever darkened .
<unk> on an opportunity , and you might look back and see it was the last chance you had to hold onto your stake , or keep your guts in your belly .
But out in this night , and this cold , there was no one to be <unk> by his speech .
Only the dread that rolled up from the deep .
It <unk> , <unk> .
“ Land is close , ” Tudre told himself .
“ It has t ’ be . ” Tudre had not realized he was moving .
His hunk of driftwood lived up to its name , <unk> edging forward into a tangled field of debris .
The corsair looked over the floating <unk> of <unk> and splinters , but found no better means to keep from drowning .
There was a bolt of sailcloth among it , but Tudre knew it would prove more a <unk> than a savior .
He had seen more than one panicked sailor <unk> by such in a storm , as good as chains if the winds and spray carried them over the side .
<unk> <unk> Tudre ’ s weathered features as the sailcloth came closer .
He put out a hand , trying to push it away , but his arm sank into it to the elbow , stealing his balance .
He snarled through clenched teeth , fighting the sails — “ Hold fast ! ” Tudre bellowed , trying to raise his voice above the storms .
“ <unk> that line ! ” He couldn ’ t tell if anyone could hear him as he moved about , shouting <unk> .
Rain and spray and shadows lashed the deck , the sails , the crew .
<unk> roared over and around them , not with wind but with voices .
A howling choir of the <unk> damned had <unk> Tudre on the last leg of his run .
His ship was fast , but not fast enough to stay ahead of it .
Their hold was swollen with treasure .
<unk> <unk> from coastal stores , trade ships at anchor , all of it easy taking as their <unk> had abandoned their posts to flee the Harrowing .
That fortune was <unk> them now .
Bowsy would have <unk> Tudre for not believing him , if he hadn ’ t been the first man plucked up by the darkness <unk> down on them .
“ <unk> ! ” Tudre whirled around , hearing the boy Flir and seeing him <unk> with a bolt of sail .
Flir was fighting desperately to <unk> the sail to the <unk> , to keep it from stripping and snapping loose , but he was losing that fight .
Tudre locked eyes with Flir , the boy pleading for his help as the oiled cloth whipped and defied his every attempt to <unk> it to a spar of timber .
Tudre weighed going toward him , but then saw splinters fly from the base of the spar , and all doubt fled .
“ <unk> — ” The timber snapped , carrying Flir up into the roiling dark .
Tudre saw his eyes , wide in terror as he flew into a cloud of twisted faces and outstretched , clutching hands .
A heartbeat later the boy vanished , just one more scream added to the choir .
“ Better him than I , ” Tudre snarled against the silent accusation of the sea .
He felt the pressure of it inside his skull , the feeling of being watched even though he was alone .
The sailcloth tangled around his <unk> , holding tighter the more he tried to escape .
“ Better him , ” he repeated , glaring down at the scrap of sail clinging to his hand , “ than <unk> ” Why ?
The cloth <unk> his wrist seemed to ask .
Tudre shivered , but not from the cold .
The mind was playing tricks now , beaten and worn out and desperate as he was .
He tried to <unk> his arm free , but stopped <unk> as he nearly lost hold of the driftwood .
“ Because I be the damn captain ! ” Tudre spat .
“ ’ <unk> my ship , and my charge .
<unk> ’ s a duty to every <unk> and <unk> aboard , not just Flir the boy .
I run off to aid him , get snatched up too , what then ?
What becomes of the rest of me crew , without me there ? ” For a moment , anger got the best of Tudre .
He twisted , pulling his arm back sharply , and the sail finally <unk> its hold .
But it swung him around , putting his back to the driftwood , and it was another second until his grip left him and he was under the water .
Silence rushed over him , and <unk> cold .
Tudre flailed for a few <unk> before <unk> control over himself .
He was a seasoned man of the sea , not some green <unk> .
He looked up , seeing the surface just above him , and tried to <unk> his arms , his legs , to raise himself back up .
But he couldn ’ t move .
It was more than just tired muscles numbed by cold .
Tudre ’ s good eye flicked this way and that , seeing only faint silhouettes in the waning moonlight .
More debris , the <unk> bits of a ship that had yet to settle down into the inky deep .
And bodies .
<unk> of women and men who called him captain .
Who relied upon you ...
The words struck Tudre , a feeling rather than a sound .
... and you betrayed them .
Tudre broke free of whatever had been holding him , panic <unk> the strength he needed to surface .
He gasped for air , twisting about in <unk> of the driftwood .
He spotted it and grabbed hold , embracing it like his first love .
It was only then , as his fingers sought purchase on its slick shape , that Tudre realized what it was .
It was part of a lifeboat .
One of the lifeboats — “ Into the lifeboats ! ” someone was screaming .
“ <unk> ship ! ” There were things on <unk> the ship now .
<unk> , horrible , blighted beasts that had <unk> from the storm like <unk> shed from a dog .
They stalked through the <unk> without effort , undisturbed by the chaos as they butchered Tudre ’ s crew with fang and claw .
Tudre and his mates had earned <unk> over their <unk> .
<unk> , merchants , <unk> , all true , but just as true were pirates , <unk> , <unk> .
They were not strangers to violence , and every one of them walked the decks with more weapons strapped to them than they had hands to carry .
But they fell to the wraiths like <unk> before the scythe .
Men and women Tudre had seen <unk> , hunt great leviathans of the deep , fight in the vanguard of <unk> actions <unk> cannon and steel , begged like children to monsters that couldn ’ t understand a thing like mercy , much less <unk> it .
All they provided was the <unk> of body and spirit .
Tudre punched and shoved his way through the mass of panicked faces <unk> around the few <unk> lifeboats the ship had .
Several had been left behind at port to <unk> weight so they could <unk> more spoils , and now men and women packed the tiny wooden craft , far more than the boats could carry .
“ Make way ! ” Tudre cuffed a shipmate aside , swinging one leg onto the closest lifeboat .
“ Hold ! ” a man called out from the bow of the lifeboat .
“ This one ’ s full up !
Any more , and she ’ ll roll us all down below . ” “ <unk> off ! ” said Tudre , fingers tightening on the hilt of the cutlass at his waist .
“ Can ’ t risk it with this many on ’ er now ! ” the man replied .
Tudre put a hand on the back of the man ’ s neck , pulling him close as though to whisper a secret in his ear .
Instead the captain ’ s cutlass found his gut , steel bursting out the man ’ s back in a <unk> of blood rendered black by the madness swallowing them all .
In one smooth motion , Tudre withdrew his blade and pitched the lifeless body over the side .
“ There , ” he hissed .
“ One body <unk> .
Now cast off ! ” “ I be a <unk> , ” Tudre argued , though the strength was missing from his words .
“ The strong live on , and the weak die .
I chose life , a chance at it , for everyone in that boat , rather than <unk> it and leaving all to drown .
They at least had the chance . ” He didn ’ t know who he was trying to convince anymore .
The sense of guilt that had become a voice was now many , thundering in his mind like <unk> cannon .
... you did this ... ... our lives <unk> ... ... your greed ... ... killed us all ... ... murderer ... ... <unk> ... Tudre lowered his head , resting his brow against the wreckage of the lifeboat , <unk> under the weight of their silent <unk> .
“ Stop . ” The moon ’ s light was nearly gone .
Tudre looked up , seeing a faint blurred strip on the horizon .
His soul flared with <unk> hope .
“ Land , ” he gasped .
<unk> , <unk> laughter bubbled from Tudre ’ s lips , overcome with relief and the prospect of seeing the sun rise over another day .
The laughter stopped abruptly , when something <unk> him from behind .
He noticed then the dark shapes all around him .
He could have sworn none of them had been near just moments before .
Yet here they floated , bobbing gently , the still flesh of his crew surrounding him .
“ I never did you ill , ” said Tudre , his voice shaking .
“ <unk> ’ we did was for yer fortune as much as mine .
All of you knew the risks .
You ’ d have done the same as me ! ” The voices <unk> Tudre seemed to <unk> from the corpses .
Their cries <unk> him , stripping his nerves bare .
“ Stop ! ” he pleaded .
“ I beg ye ! ” But they would not <unk> .
They merged into a single terrible chorus , repeating a single word like a dirge to drive down and bury in Tudre ’ s heart .
<unk> !
“ No ! ” he screamed in <unk> , the sound carrying over the lightless water .
As one , the spirits of Tudre ’ s crew sat up , <unk> away from their bodies .
Flir , Bowsy , all of them staring at him with slack faces and <unk> eyes .
No sound left their blue lips , but Tudre ’ s head was filled to bursting with their rage .
“ No , ” he wailed , <unk> his eyes shut .
“ Just leave me be ! ” Suddenly the driftwood sank a fraction , as though under added weight .
Tudre forced open his eyes , and found himself staring up into the face of death .
It was a woman , tall and <unk> , standing atop the driftwood with a balance that was as <unk> as it was impossible .
Where her flesh should have been was instead smoldering , spectral blue energy .
She was clad in battered armor and a helm with a long , black <unk> .
A trio of spears had been driven through her chest , and she had another gripped in her hand .
The sight of her turned Tudre ’ s <unk> cold and <unk> .
Everyone knew the legends , the whispered things a man could laugh off as stories meant to <unk> children .
<unk> of an avatar of revenge , appearing wherever <unk> had been done and voices cried out for <unk> .
They cried out for Lady Vengeance , and with spear in hand , she would answer with damnation .
Tudre ’ s crew came closer , the woman ’ s eerie light reflected in their blazing , <unk> eyes .
“ No , ” Tudre pleaded , as the sight before him , cutting him off from the promise of land ahead , wrenched away the last of his resolve .
“ I was only <unk> ’ to make me way in this world .
My crew didn ’ t deserve their fate , no , but nor do I deserve this .
You don ’ t know what it be like , leading those in your command to their doom , to be responsible for the damnation of their very souls ! ” <unk> life was brought to her cold , <unk> features , almost as if there was a sound in the distance that only she could hear .
The woman glared down at Tudre , boring into the core of him .
<unk> twisted her face in a rictus for an instant , and then it was gone .
Slowly she lowered her spear , resting it just under Tudre ’ s throat .
She pushed , though not with enough pressure to pierce his flesh and <unk> him .
Just enough to separate him from the driftwood , and push him under the water .
Tudre ’ s mind screamed to fight , the urge to survive willing him to rise , but he could not .
The spear tip at his throat held him beneath .
Tudre looked up at that shimmering , <unk> visage .
Lady Vengeance had come for him at last .
The voices had all gone silent .
His crew sank down with him , closing around him like fingers making a fist .
All light faded .
Tudre finally succumbed to the deep , and drew her into his lungs .
The last bubbles slipped from his lips as he drifted lower into the darkness , and he went down , just in sight of land .
= = = = = = <unk> = = = = = = = = JARED ROSEN = = Each time Viego thought of her face , it looked a little different .
Sometimes , the eyes were just too far apart , or too close together .
Or her cheeks were a little too thin or a little too wide .
Sometimes , her hands lacked the calluses of a seamstress , but other times , they were <unk> and thick from long days holding scissors and needles .
She wore a gown some days , and others , a simple work frock , and on others still , she wore nothing at all .
She was never the same , but always the same , never there , but always present .
A ghost of the heart Viego no longer possessed , <unk> open when ... when ... Viego , on his shattered , blackened throne at the bottom of the world , slammed his king ’ s blade deeply into the rock beneath , cracking the obsidian and sending a brutal <unk> across the entirety of the Shadow Isles .
To his left lay a painting he could no longer bear to look at , for the fair Isolde ’ s <unk> had been too perfect to lay eyes upon , too lovely to grant him any peace or respite .
He had torn her away , leaving only the image of a foolish young king who had believed the world was kind centuries before , but who now was <unk> dead .
Or if not dead , something else .
Viego could not remember much of his old country that was not twisted by shadows or anguish .
In his memories , he stepped out upon the <unk> streets and only saw Isolde before him .
Every <unk> on every wall <unk> her within a <unk> world that only he could touch , only he could see .
Yet when he went to reach for her , the illusion broke away , and he was here , surrounded on all sides by the putrid waters that had stolen her all over again .
Viego ripped his blade from the ground and stood , smashing its great heft into the floor and walls as he wailed .
Then he was still for a long while , <unk> the ancient painting from the old kingdom as if he had seen something new .
<unk> himself as he was before the Isles had been swallowed up by darkness .
“ Viego , ” he said .
“ So handsome .
So young .
What became of you , Viego ?
Where have you gone ? ” He dropped the painting to the floor , its frame cracking awkwardly as the canvas crumpled beneath it .
“ Where are you , Isolde ? ” said Viego .
“ Why won ’ t you come back to me ? ” But he already knew the answer .
To most , the Black Mist is a plague , a <unk> for monstrous , <unk> wraiths to assault the living and steal them away until the sun <unk> and the world <unk> into nothing .
To Viego , it is his great , unending sadness , pouring ceaselessly from his broken heart .
A <unk> to his love , of better days long gone by , and a cruel <unk> of what was taken from him so long ago .
It is this very Mist that <unk> the land , tendrils infecting everything with their grim power , draining the life from whatever they touch until all that remains <unk> with the soft , necrotic green of the Ruination .
Yet this , too , has a purpose , for as Viego ’ s sadness <unk> and wanes , the Mist <unk> forward , searching as if drawn to something ... something old , familiar , safe .
The wraiths and spirits that travel within it do what they will , but the Mist itself , no — it <unk> ceaselessly for her .
Everything Viego does is for her .
And now , it has found something , far from the shores of the Isles , far past the docks of Bilgewater and the coasts of Ionia .
Something on the mainland , hidden within a <unk> city at the edge of a river .
The <unk> calls to Viego , screams for Viego , demands his attention at all <unk> .
And though the people wail , though they run from the blanket of death that <unk> softly across their homes and fields , though the wraiths shriek and the horrors stir to feed , Viego hears but one voice , and one voice alone .
“ Viego , ” he <unk> it says , for he cannot make out the words .
The Ruined King bursts from the fog like a hungry shadow , tearing through the first guard he sees as he lifts his blade high above the ground .
The man ’ s face <unk> in pain as his body <unk> away and his spirit is absorbed into the Mist , but Viego barely <unk> him any attention before he brings his sword down upon the second .
Everywhere around him , <unk> feast upon the living , tearing them apart as their souls are dragged away to join the king ’ s <unk> .
Searing flesh sails through the air , <unk> tumble across space , swords clatter , and warriors fall .
It does not matter to Viego .
He <unk> a single hand before the city ’ s great wall , and the Mist rushes forward , stones falling away as the structure becomes tainted with <unk> .
Viego simply steps across the threshold , and suddenly , he is through .
He cuts down two more men as he moves silently toward the source of the voice , then another .
They mean nothing .
None of them bear any weight , and not one matters at all .
Their spirits simply rise behind him , to do as he <unk> .
The <unk> of this city now stands before him , a proud man protecting a treasure of some kind , Viego is sure .
But as a fellow leader , as a skilled warrior , perhaps he would make a better <unk> than hungry spirit .
“ Stop , ” says Viego , raising a single hand once more .
The Mist , the wraiths , the horrors , the fighting — everything seems to freeze on the Ruined King ’ s command .
“ Behind you is a treasure you could not <unk> the importance of .
I will see it returned to me , and in <unk> , you will serve me personally . ” The man seems to stumble over his words , grasping at something he cannot quite muster the courage to speak .
But Viego gives him time , and slowly , the words form on his lips : “ If I give you this treasure , will you spare the city ? ” The Ruined King seems disappointed .
<unk> he <unk> an answer or <unk> on the <unk> , this man will never know , as Viego suddenly appears above him , his great blade slicing down through the heart of this small , frightened <unk> .
His body <unk> harmlessly down the massive <unk> , as <unk> spreads across his skin .
Viego rips the door behind him open , and there , the treasure lies .
An old , <unk> music box , a gift from Viego ’ s <unk> day , whispering something he cannot quite hear .
It seems possessed by grief , by boundless , <unk> sorrow , but Viego simply holds it before his eyes , imagining the soft smile that will surely dance across Isolde ’ s face the day he sees her again .
“ What have they done to you , my love ? ” he <unk> , as the man he slaughtered slowly rises from the earth , ghostly greens and blues throbbing from between the cracks in his skin .
“ Do not worry , ” he <unk> the music box .
“ I will find you .
It is simply a matter of time . ” And with that , Viego is gone , vanishing as wraiths <unk> the city .
