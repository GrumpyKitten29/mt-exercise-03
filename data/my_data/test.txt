= = = = = = THE VOICES OF THE DEAD = = = = = = = = DAVID SLAGLE = = There ’ s a saying on my island .
“ Only through stealing our breath can the wind speak . ” You want me to describe the Black Mist that greeted me when I first arrived in the Ionian village , hood raised , relic cannon on my back ?
The Mist steals words too .
The screams of those who die within .
Once , they were my screams — but I ’ m alive now .
I felt the warmth where Lucian ’ s hand touched my shoulder as we stepped off the boat onto Ionian soil , somehow reaching through my walls the way only he can .
The way he ’ s the only fool stubborn enough to try .
To learn the one thing that gets through my armor , and all the rules beneath , is love .
“ You go high , I go low ? ” I asked , feeling his warmth go cold as he considered .
For a moment , he didn ’ t see me standing before him .
He saw the woman he tried to save , who was cursed , always running .
He saw the scythe , swinging toward her … He looked straight into her eyes , even as he looked into mine .
“ I go low , ” he said , leaving other things to silence .
And now his hands were on his guns .
“ Senna … ” His voice broke with the weight of the memory .
“ It ’ s okay , ” I said softly .
I could remember that woman too .
On the horizon , darkness swirled , casting even darker shadows onto a village carved into stone , deluged by heavy rain , and worse .
Somewhere in that darkness was light .
Another Sentinel who ’ d called us here .
I ’ d have to fight my way to it .
The path up the mountain to the village was nearly worn away by centuries of storms , washing away everything but the toughest crags … if that ’ s the right damn word .
I could feel the wind pressing against my hood , the spray of the ocean hard against my skin , as if the world were pushing me back , warning me of the darkness ahead .
But none of that compared to what hit me as a howl rose up , roaring through the village … It was my curse .
The Mist knew I was here .
It would come for me before anyone else .
“ Must be time for my daily ambush , ” I muttered , unmoved , and from a horizon black with death , souls poured forth .
Drawn to me as I drew breath .
As I drew my weapon .
The relic stones of fallen Sentinels moved as one , each held by too many hands before mine .
Men and women , fathers , sisters , all lost to darkness .
But when I held my weapon , I held their light , gleaming in the gun ’ s two barrels .
A tendril of Mist hit me as the wraith within took shape .
Staggered by the blow , I stumbled back , catching my footing just before falling toward the rocks below .
Thunder pealed as the screams of souls joined the rain and crashing waves that besieged the island .
But the flash of light that followed wasn ’ t lightning .
It was my relic cannon , the shot boiling the wraith into shadow .
It required control .
It required focus .
I needed to fight the Mist with every fiber of my being .
And I could not stop .
Not for a moment of my life .
With every shot that burned a wraith away , another was revealed .
I was so close to the village now , I could see new wraiths rising , sent spiraling toward me .
Into blessed light .
“ Anabal , are you there ? ” I called out .
I ’ d met him only once , when Urias brought me to a meeting of Sentinels .
It was rare for Sentinels to gather , but something had frightened Urias that made him call them all together .
He never told me what it was , but I could tell by the way the others looked at me … It hurt more when they didn ’ t know .
When they tried to get past my armor , only to find the reason it was there .
Still firing , I advanced further into the village .
The wraiths moved fast , swooping into buildings nearly as old as the island itself , carved from the same stone .
But there was order in the chaos .
The wraiths were circling above .
They wanted something .
Not just life .
Not just souls .
Not just me … “ Anabal ! ” I called again , barely hearing myself over the storm .
“ Over here !
Hurry ! ” a panicked voice responded .
It was the voice of a girl … and then her light joined mine in the darkness .
Anabal ’ s apprentice , Daowan .
She stood above a crumpled body , two figures in the dark .
The light of Anabal ’ s relic-stone glaive glowed dully on her face , concentration clear on her brow as she defended her fallen mentor .
He had managed to pass the torch , then … his relic stone was not lost .
“ We have to get out of here , ” the girl said with a shudder .
“ We have to get the villagers out of here .
I can still hear them .
It must be them … ” She paused and looked down at the shape at her feet , in confused agony .
“ I can still hear him … ” But even as her knuckles grew white , clenching the haft of her glaive , I put my relic cannon on my back .
I reached out gently and took her shoulder .
“ We ’ re going to get through this , ” I said .
Beyond her , I saw the entrance to the village catacombs .
Swarming with wraiths .
“ All of us , ” I added softly .
Whatever the Mist wanted , it was there .
The catacombs had been carved out by countless floods .
As we left the village behind , heading underground , still the storm made itself known , water rolling down the walls around us .
But if we were going to drown in the depths , it wouldn ’ t be from rising sea , or falling squall … It would be in the Black Mist that rolled like a wave to meet us , swallowing our light in a liquid roar .
I could hear the screams of the people from my village , torn away when I was just a girl and first saw death .
I could hear the echoes of my own , and see the look on Lucian ’ s face , when death first saw me .
I was hit by the rage and fear of the people still dying above , their cries in a language I couldn ’ t understand , but speaking of pain I knew all too well .
Wraiths rose up throughout the catacombs , trapped in a rictus of the agony they meant to inflict .
But no matter how loud the screams of the living , the sound could never drown out their own .
And no matter how brightly my light burned , it could never hurt them worse than when the darkness returned .
And so instead … I embraced them , before death could .
My call was irresistible .
I could draw the Mist to myself , away from others .
I felt death rush in , push the lie of my body away .
As the Mist clung to me , one by one , it let the souls go .
All who had been drawn here .
All who had died above .
For a moment , I thought I saw Anabal … Only one vague shape lingered , a will still slowly awakening .
It hovered for a moment before turning to face me , rage burning where there were no eyes .
“ No , ” I whispered through the shroud of death that had transformed me into a wraith .
“ You don ’ t get to speak .
You listen . ” Pushing the Mist into my gun , I fired all the pain and fear I ’ d gathered back at its source , where it was deserved .
As darkness collided with darkness , the light within me glowed .
Life wouldn ’ t let me go .
I felt my body return , as the last of the Mist left me .
With a gasp , I fell to my knees .
“ What did I miss ? ” a voice asked , emerging from deeper in the tunnels .
“ You know .
The usual , ” I said coolly , though I was still catching my breath .
“ Ruined King raiding catacombs to find who knows what ? ” Lucian asked .
“ Pretty much , ” I answered .
I looked up at Daowan , realization dawning on her face .
Her glaive was still pointed at me .
There ’ s a saying on my island .
“ Only through stealing our breath can the wind speak . ” In the roaring clamor of the Black Mist , I hear the words of the dead .
And I ’ m here to give their voices back .
= = = = = = VOICES = = = = = = = = JARED ROSEN = = Ten great kings took ten great thrones , Nine crowns adorned nine heads .
One left to scratch upon their mounds , The crow , alive and dead .
— old Demacian poem , author unknown It started when old Hubard , drunk out his mind on stale mead and the dulled memories of some battle he ’ d probably run from , locked himself in a shack just outside of Goldweald .
Davil tried to break the door in , good neighbor as he was , but the miserable fossil had more strength than anyone could have anticipated , bracing his entire body against the entrance as he babbled about heights and spiders and being pecked to death by birds .
No one believed the man was being pecked to death by anything but a bottle , so we all went home , assuming , as one does , that with a day to dry out , the ordeal would sort itself .
Took only one night .
First scream ripped across the village like someone had pulled it out of Hubard ’ s open chest , followed by a second that was almost the same — but worse .
It pitched higher , like rusted metal wrapped in burlap , in almost-human words with an almost-human rhythm until the baker ’ s wife cried , “ Mages ! ” and all hell broke loose .
People arming themselves , the mayor — if that &apos;s what you could call the head of some hinterlands piss-hole — shooing whoever he could into the meeting hall , windows being boarded up in blind panic , the works .
You ’ ve seen it a hundred times , probably two hundred since the Claw hit up north .
Regular folks going mad at the fairest hint of magic .
Point is , that ’ s around when everything went bad .
But there ’ s a bottom to bad , and what happened in Goldweald broke right past it .
Don ’ t believe me ?
Go for yourself .
Goldweald ain ’ t there anymore .
But I ’ m skipping ahead , and that ain ’ t fair to Davil .
See , Davil was a spy from back when the Freljord pacifications were still talked about like there was honor in ’ em , and he later served the crown as far out as Shurima and the Blue Flame Isles .
The man had seen things .
We ’ re lucky out west , since the worst the hinterlands have to offer are some stray raptors after the hatching season , and maybe a sun-cooked bandit or three , but Davil knew what was out there .
What could be out there .
And he gathered up all the folk who were willing to listen and organized a peasant militia to bring those supposed “ mages ” to justice .
His plan was simple : First light , we ’ re all going on patrol , two by two , no one alone .
Military stuff , and that gives us hope , gins us all up for a fight .
For king and country !
Rah-rah Demacia , and all that .
Until the sun comes up and a family ’ s gone missing .
Every one of them — five in all .
Farmhouse torn to shreds , livestock slaughtered in their pens .
Doors all locked from the inside , windows all latched .
They ’ re gone .
The mayor calls a meeting , but a pair of fieldhands don ’ t come in from the rows .
When Davil calls for them , something calls back .
But it isn ’ t them .
Sounds almost like them , like something is forcing words into almost the right shape , but that old , rusty cage sound keeps cutting through , squeaking and rattling and clicking like it can ’ t help itself .
Now people are afraid .
Some hothead charges into the fields with a sword in his hand — gone .
Another follows him — gone .
Blacksmith gets the wise idea he ’ ll ride all the way to Amberfel and call the guard , but the horse bucks him halfway down the old trade road and something pulls him into the rows .
Davil calls to see if he ’ s alright , and that awful voice burbles out , saying it ’ ll take the road to Amberfel and call the guard .
Davil asks again , and it repeats : “ I ’ ll take the old road to Amberfel and call the guard . ” There ’ s something about it … like a pin twisting inside your head , poking through the meat into something darker underneath .
I could see it on everyone ’ s faces .
Folks holding their kids close , backing away toward their homes , some just running .
That voice could cut away all the parts of a person and leave ’ em naked and afraid , shivering in the middle of a blistering afternoon .
Like it was pulling something out of you .
Something it wanted .
A little girl says she saw someone standing above the field out where we keep the scarecrow .
It ’ s such an odd thing to notice , and there ’ s so much going on , that we pay her no mind .
But we should have .
Night comes and half the houses in town are boarded shut .
You can hear folks inside whispering , muttering , giggling like maniacs , but about … I ’ m not sure .
Snakes .
Lightning .
The dark .
Walls closing in .
Knives .
The sea .
They ’ re laughing and they ’ re screaming and it sounds like everyone has gone insane , like they ’ re trapped inside a room with a part of themselves they don ’ t want to face .
It sounds like we ’ re all stuck in a nightmare .
Then the lights start going out .
One after the other in all the boarded-up houses , the lamps flicker and die .
And the voices melt away , each suddenly silenced , all save for one .
Something croaking behind the old smithy .
Muttering to itself .
About snakes .
About lighting .
Muttering about the dark .
Davil , that poor fool , takes the militia and goes in .
And I … I ’ m there with him .
I have my blade .
I have my lantern .
But the rows are deep , and the light casts shadows everywhere you look .
I … I don ’ t know exactly what happened .
I saw a face — maybe .
Something looking back at me just ahead of Davil , but it was like he saw right past it .
Like that face was just there for me .
All lopsided , twisted sackcloth and rusted teeth .
And behind it … something huge .
Splayed out on thin legs , but alive with hundreds of black birds rattling inside an old cage we ’ d thrown into the woods last year .
And eyes .
So many eyes .
There ’ s no one left in Goldweald now .
If no one came after me … I ’ m the only one left .
Hearing those screams fade behind me as crimson light poured out from between the corn stalks — that sickly crunching , and the bellowing , tortured squeals of hogs and horses … And the crows !
Hundreds of them — thousands !
But crows they aren ’ t , can ’ t you see ?
They ’ re smoke and fire !
They ’ re not real !
They couldn ’ t be real … They follow that voice !
The deep , rumbling voice beneath it all !
Don ’ t you see ?
Don ’ t you — Oh , gods … Davil !
I left him behind !
I left him there — there in the rows with that horrible scarecrow !
Everyone — they ’ re all dead !
Gods , gods , it must have followed me .
Once it tastes your fear , once it knows you , it never lets go .
It won ’ t let you go , it won ’ t — What ’ s that voice ?
Can anyone hear — You don ’ t hear it ?
… Davil ?
= = = = = = THE CAGE = = = = = = = = ODIN AUSTIN SHAFER = = Darkness .
The breath I cannot take plagues me .
It is an emptiness in my lungs and throat .
As if I had stopped mid-breath , and then held my lungs cruelly waiting .
My mouth open , throat hollow , unable to pull in air .
My chest , the horrible tension on my thorax .
My limbs and muscles refuse to move .
I cannot breathe .
I am choking .
The pressure builds .
The stillness spreads to my chest and limbs .
I want to scream , to tear at my face , to wail — but I am trapped .
I cannot move .
I cannot move .
Darkness .
I must remember .
I must remem — The battle .
I lost control .
It was foolish .
The mortals formed in ranks against me .
I crashed into them .
Drank from them .
The temptation was too great .
As I reaped , I reforged their flesh into a better approximation of my true shape .
Desperately , I consumed more and more , hoping for the briefest echo of what I once was .
Instead , like a fire , I burned too quickly , destroying even my host ’ s form .
Darkness .
It was raining when we fought .
What if the mud and filth cover me ?
What if I ’ m hidden for thousands of years ?
Trapped in this prison .
The horror of that idea feeds my panic .
The battle is ending .
I can feel it .
I must will my form upright .
I must … I must ...
I have no arms or legs .
The darkness binds me , like a cocoon .
No .
I will myself upright .
But I can ’ t know if it is working .
I cannot know anything but the darkness .
Please .
Let some mortal find me .
Please .
I beg the darkness endlessly , but the humiliation of my plea is answered only with silence .
But then … I feel a mortal nearby .
I have no eyes , no ears , but I can feel his approach .
He is fleeing from adversaries .
He must try to defend himself .
He must grasp me .
Can he see me ?
He could run past me .
I would be left here .
I feel his hand grip this form and … and his consciousness opens to me !
I burrow into him , pulling him down .
I am like a drowning man thrown into the sea by a shipwreck , dragging myself to the surface by clawing past my fellows .
“ What ’ s happening ?
! ” the mortal screams .
But he is silenced by the darkness — the endless darkness I have just escaped .
And I have eyes .
I can see the falling rain .
The muck .
The blood of this slaughtering field .
In front of me stand two weary knights with spears .
I cut them apart , and drink in their forms , recrafting this body to my needs .
They are weak .
I must move quickly .
I must find a better wielder .
A better host .
Around me are only the dead and dying .
I hear their souls retreating from this world .
The fighting has not ended .
It ’ s moved inside the city walls .
I force my new shape — limping , crawling — toward the sounds of battle .
Toward a better host .
I roar .
But not in triumph .
Never in triumph .
I will drink from that city , but I will achieve only a grotesque mockery of my former glory .
I was shaped by the stars , and the purity of my aspect .
I was light and reason given shape .
I defended this world in the greatest battles ever known .
Now , blood and ichor drips from this stolen flesh as it decays .
The muscles and bones struggle , tear , and protest the abomination I have become .
I take a breath .
“ No , Aatrox , ” I say , my voice wet and echoing off the dead that surround me .
“ We will go onward ... and onward … and onward … ” Until the final oblivion comes .
= = = = = = YOU ARE THE WEAPON = = = = = = = = DAVID SLAGLE = = He started his training with a single breath .
In , and out .
He could hear water dripping through a crack in the cave ceiling , dampening the stone floor until it gleamed against the darkness .
He knew the holy patterns carved into the floor ’ s stone — proclaiming destinies and orbits .
Even when he closed his eyes , he could see each lunar arc .
He made a few tentative swings with his blade .
The moonstone felt solid in his hand , but remained ethereal , as if it wasn ’ t there .
It was a magical remnant of the first convergence when the moon and its reflection in the spirit realm briefly touched across the celestial veil , and moonstone cast off by the union rained down on the world like tears .
Following their orbits , the two moons were forced to part .
Embracing his own orbit , Aphelios continued to train .
His blade was now his breath , drawing faster and faster .
His slashes followed arcs he had practiced for years until even he bled , training to the verge of self-destruction .
Following his weapon , he twisted through the air .
He slashed , parried — each attack flowing into the next .
He closed his eyes so he would not need to see … would not remember everything he ’ d sacrificed to wield his weapon .
“ Aphelios … ” You see my face .
My lip quivers , though my voice is firm .
“ Aphelios . ” Reflected in my eyes , you see … Aphelios stumbled as his moonstone blade flashed red and an image of an outlander passed before him .
A vision ?
A memory ?
How many times had he killed to not know for sure ?
The blade slipped from his hand , and Aphelios soon followed — colliding against the floor with no weapon to lead him , losing grasp of his discipline .
It had all come back .
Everything he pushed down .
Every cut of his blade into his enemies cut even deeper into himself .
Alune … his sister .
She ’ d reached across the veil .
She ’ d shown him … but she ’ d been torn away .
Aphelios pushed troubled words he would never say back into his throat .
His fingers tightened into a fist , only for a moment , ready to strike against the orbits and destinies carved into stone .
But , hand shaking … he let go .
As Aphelios stood and swept back his hair , he noticed the moon had risen , its light shining onto a shrine he kept deeper in the temple .
Calling to him , as it did whenever he was needed .
It was time .
His faith would be rewarded .
The Lunari ’ s power was growing , phasing across the celestial veil .
A magic of spirit , of the secrets within — for all of his training , Aphelios could not channel the moon ’ s power himself .
But he would not need to .
He carefully prepared noctum flowers that he ’ d cultivated in the shrine ’ s pool , pressing their essence into a caustic elixir — the liquid glowing faintly within the mortar bowl .
He set aside his training blade and raised the bowl to the moon ’ s light .
Then , without hesitation , he pressed the flower ’ s poison to his lips .
The agony is indescribable .
The pain wraps around your throat .
You cannot say anything at all … Everything burns .
You convulse in misery , you retch and cough as the poison flows through you , opening you to the moon ’ s power … To me .
“ Aphelios , ” I whisper from my fortress , and my spirit brushes against yours .
You sense my presence across the veil .
You raise your hand , knowing that I am too far .
That it is the pain you must hold on to .
You close your hand around it .
It becomes your weapon .
I send it to you … Gravitum .
“ Aphelios , ” I whisper as I feel you cling to the poison that burns you away .
Knowing why you make this choice .
What I ask you to sacrifice … With a final lung-wracking gasp , Aphelios emerged from the cave temple into the night .
His expression hardened as he fought back the wrenching agony , embracing it and leaving everything else behind him .
Mount Targon loomed above and below the temple , stretching in both directions .
The howling wind whipped up frozen wisps that shimmered as they faded , dancing with Aphelios ’ scarf and buffeting his cloak .
The light of the moon shone higher still .
It would guide him .
It was her light , shining through the moon ’ s .
She ’ d given him what he needed .
Gravitum was more than a moonstone blade .
In training , he had slashed , stabbed , twirled .
To use this weapon , he would do the same — but his reach would be much greater .
A simple thrust would unleash its power , his skill and her magic converging .
Firing the cannon ’ s black orbs toward a floating rock that was suspended by the Targon ’ s heavenly magic , Gravitum ’ s power slowly drew the island down .
With a single leap , Aphelios began running atop the island , his boots casting small drifts of snow into the abyss .
Each orb he fired drew another rock close , the floating monoliths colliding behind him as he leapt from one to the next , swiftly scaling a mountain that would take most people days to climb … if they attempted the climb at all .
Only the Solari , and those who sought power , held vigil here .
He passed their settlements below , each quiet and ignorant of the night .
For years , he had wondered how Solari zealots could deny his faith ’ s existence , walking their paths to follow the sun , fearing darkness that only Lunari dared face .
But his destiny was clear .
The zealots would be revealed by the moon ’ s light .
Aphelios leapt to a final island of stone and paused above a snowy clearing where a party of Solari had gathered , their weapons blazing .
Burning Ones , the Lunari called them .
By night , they scorched out heretics of the moon .
By day , their priests denied there was anything but the sun .
Beneath dark hoods , their faces were hidden by flame as impersonal as their judgment .
They had surrounded a barbarian cloaked in crimson and steel .
The outlander he ’ d seen in his vision .
The moon ’ s light stopped in this clearing .
It stopped at the barbarian ’ s feet .
“ Aphelios , ” I say again .
I whisper it to your soul and gather my magic , knowing the only words you want to hear .
“ I am with you … ” Aphelios dived off the rock island and plummeted into battle , the Burning Ones ’ weapons blazing all the brighter as Gravitum ’ s darkness spread among them .
Crying out in alarm , the Solari turned to fight , but found themselves bound to the ground by a black orb .
Aphelios dropped the cannon , and a new weapon appeared in his hand .
“ Severum , ” I whisper .
Landing from his descent without looking away from his enemies ’ burning faces , Aphelios slashed behind him with Severum , the crescent pistol ’ s beam tearing through the island of stone .
Terrified , the Burning Ones could only watch as massive slabs slammed down among them , cut loose by the energy of the waning moon .
The survivors quickly spread across the clearing , lashing at Aphelios with their molten spears .
Weaving between the blows , Aphelios continued to slash with Severum and reached out with his free hand to grasp one more weapon as it passed through the veil , knowing it would be there .
“ Crescendum , ” I say to the night .
With a soaring arc , Crescendum cut through the throats of the remaining Solari in the clearing — Aphelios catching the moonstone blade as it twisted around and returned to his hand .
In seconds , it was over .
The barbarian stands before you .
He looks up , gratefully .
Beside him , what the Burning Ones sought : a scimitar curved like the moon .
He opens his mouth to thank you , but he sees your expression twist , though you try to hide it .
You fight the fear , punching your shoulder where the Burning Ones ’ spears cut through your cloak .
Trying to remember the pain .
Reaching for it .
You don ’ t want to kill him .
But you must .
Your face is too numb for you to feel the tears … Instead , you feel mine .
“ Aphelios , ” I say one last time , forcing my voice through the veil .
There is a dizzying rush as our orbits bring us together .
Through your eyes , I see what moonlight reveals around the scimitar .
Why it was abandoned .
She is running … We must find her .
The crimson-clad barbarian lay in the snow among the Solari .
With a gasp , Aphelios fell to his knees .
He glanced up at the moon , listening for a whisper only he could hear .
His expression dulled again .
Without a word , he picked up the scimitar and walked into the night .
= = = = = = TROUBLE = = = = = = = = MICHAEL YICHAO = = If there was one thing Marcin knew how to do , it was to keep his head down .
Before him , rowdy voices intermingled with the clatter of tankards and the sloshing of beer .
Every once in a while , someone barked a drink order , and just as soon as their coin landed on the bar , a drink slid in front of their waiting hands .
His quick and silent service kept him unnoticed — and as such , uninvolved in any trouble .
And there was always trouble .
It took on many forms .
A belligerent brawler , itching for a fight .
A transaction among cloaked figures that ended with a dagger through a throat .
Or , perhaps most unexpectedly , a little girl , pushing through the heavy tavern door .
Marcin watched the girl hum and skip her way toward the bar .
Behind her , the door slammed shut , one last swirl of winter air blasting across the room , the loud bang grabbing the last few eyes that weren ’ t already following her , baffled by her presence .
The girl clambered up a stool , barely peeking over the edge of the bar .
Marcin took in the child ’ s bright red hair , the tattered toy clutched in her grip , the frayed satchel on her back , and the ragged , unseasonably short-sleeved , dress .
“ What can I get for you ? ” he asked .
The girl stood on the stool and plopped her toy on the counter , peering at the many bottles on shelves .
Marcin could see it was a stuffed bear , once well crafted , since well loved .
The stitching at its limbs were visible after many years of stress .
Somewhere in its life it had lost one of its button eyes .
“ Could I get a glass of milk , please ? ” Marcin raised an eyebrow but said nothing .
He walked toward the far end of the bar to fetch the ceramic jug .
“ Awfully late for you to be out by yourself , ain ’ t it ? ” a deep voice rumbled .
Marcin sighed .
Trouble always attracted more trouble .
He pulled the jug down from the shelf and gazed back down the bar .
A large man next to the girl had turned to peer down at her with his one good eye .
Seated in front of him , the girl looked like a pebble at the foot of a mountain .
He was a pile of muscles criss-crossed with scars .
The loops of ropes , chains , and hooks at his belt , along with the massive blade slung across his back , loudly announced him as a bounty hunter .
The girl looked up at him and flashed a smile .
“ I ’ m not alone .
Tibbers is here with me .
Aren ’ t you , Tibbers ? ” She held up the bear , beaming .
The bounty hunter laughed out loud .
“ Surely your parents must be missing you . ” The girl ’ s hands dropped to her side as her eyes drifted down and away .
“ I don ’ t think so , ” she replied .
“ Aw , but I do think so .
Would pay a pretty penny to see you home safe , I imagine . ” Marcin could practically hear the coins clinking in the bounty hunter ’ s mind , the man already tallying up the prize for her safe return .
“ They can ’ t .
They ’ re dead . ” The girl plopped back down on the stool , staring into the button eye of her bear .
The bounty hunter started to speak again just as Marcin placed the mug down on the counter with a percussive thud .
“ Your milk , ” he said .
The girl turned and beamed at him , breaking from her sullen mood .
“ Thank you , sir ! ” She set her bear on the table and reached back into her knapsack .
Marcin waited , prepared to accept any coin she put down as payment enough .
He did not expect the massive purse that landed with a clatter .
A few golden coins bounced onto the counter , one rolling toward the edge .
Marcin stopped it on reflex , one finger pinning the escapee .
Slowly , he lifted it from the bar , its heft and texture proclaiming it as authentic Noxian mint .
“ Oopsie ! ” the little girl giggled .
Marcin swallowed , his mouth suddenly dry .
He reached over , hoping to shove the coin and the purse back into the girl ’ s satchel before anyone else noticed — “ That ’ s a mighty big purse for a mighty small girl , ” the bounty hunter growled , far too loudly .
“ Tibbers found it , ” the girl replied .
The bounty hunter snorted .
“ Is that so ? ” “ It was on the man who stopped me in the road .
He was a real meanie . ” The girl took a sip of her milk , her attention back on her bear .
