“ That ’ s too bad … ” The bounty hunter leaned in closer on his stool , hand sliding towards the purse .
The girl looked up at him , a playful smile dancing across her face .
“ Tibbers ate him . ” For a moment , everything stood still .
Then the bounty hunter ’ s laugh cut across the room .
“ I ’ m sure he did , ” he roared .
He thrust a meaty hand forward , grasping the toy by the head and yanking it away from the girl .
“ This big ol ’ scary monster . ” “ Let Tibbers go ! ” the girl cried out , reaching up for the bear .
“ He doesn ’ t like being pulled . ” The bounty hunter just laughed harder .
Marcin pocketed the coin in his hand and turned away , walking unnoticed toward the back .
He wished he could help , but he hadn ’ t survived this long by sticking around longer than he should .
Her voice stopped him cold .
“ I said .
Let .
Tibbers .
Go . ” The words rumbled with gravel and rage , cutting through the din .
Against all his better judgement , Marcin paused and looked back .
The girl stood on the bar , staring at the bounty hunter , fury smoldering in her eyes .
Then chaos erupted .
A flare of light and a burst of heat erupted from the girl .
Too late , Marcin threw his arms up , crying out in pain .
He stumbled back , knocking into the shelves behind him .
Several bottles crashed around him as he ducked beneath the bar , cursing his idiotic hesitation .
The screams of men and the sound of breaking wood punctuated a growing roar of flame .
A guttural , impossible sound reverberated through the air , rattling his bones .
Marcin crawled , still half-blinded , toward where he hoped the doors to the kitchens were .
Around him , the screams heightened — then stopped with a stomach-turning crack .
For the second time that day , Marcin forgot all his honed skills of avoiding trouble and peered over the edge of the bar .
A hulking beast loomed , silhouetted against the firelight .
Thick strands of sinew bound its limbs to its torso like stitching .
With a start , Marcin realized the beast itself burned , unharmed by the hungry tongues of flame that danced across its fur .
In its claws it held aloft , by the head , the slumped , bloody form of the bounty hunter , a limp rag doll in the massive paws of the monster .
Before it , the little girl stood wreathed in fire .
“ You ’ re right , Tibbers , ” she said .
“ He didn ’ t like being pulled either . ” Marcin looked around the room in horror .
Throughout his tavern , overturned chairs and tables ignited , raising a thick , black smoke .
The smell of blood and burning flesh crawled inside his nose , and Marcin choked back a cough , his stomach turning .
The beast turned and looked at him .
A whimper escaped Marcin ’ s lips .
He gazed into the glowing abyss of the bear ’ s eyes , and swallowed in the certainty of his end .
A peal of laughter rang out over the crackle of flames .
“ Don ’ t worry , ” the little girl said , peering around the monstrosity .
“ Tibbers likes you . ” Marcin watched , frozen , as the girl hopped , skipped , jumped her way through the burning tavern , the beast lumbering behind her .
He stared as it smashed the heavy door off its hinges .
He gaped as the little girl turned back one last time , a sweet smile back on her face .
“ Thanks for the milk , sir . ” And then , the girl walked out into the snowy night as the tavern collapsed behind her .
= = = = = = PINWHEEL = = = = = = = = JARED ROSEN = = “ Okay , ” Kai ’ Sa <unk> , looking up at the shape growing in front of , above , and <unk> all around her .
The monster ’ s wings spread twenty arm lengths in every direction , <unk> her field of vision — not that Kai ’ Sa has a choice where to look with the <unk> <unk> human arms holding her head against the wall .
The creature ’ s mass continues to <unk> and fills the ocean of nightmares it calls home , each glistening tooth now the size of a grown <unk> ... and getting bigger .
Its four predatory eyes gaze down on Kai ’ Sa with cold <unk> .
<unk> hunger .
At this scale , it ’ s hard to tell .
She liked it better when it was <unk> .
“ Okay , ” she repeats .
She can ’ t move her armor , which is frozen in a sort of <unk> ... awe ?
The suit is a parasite , and one of the more base creatures the Void can spit out .
Is awe even something it can feel ?
Either way , her body is stuck in place .
<unk> something <unk> <unk> , this is probably the end .
Kai ’ Sa ’ s mind <unk> through a few <unk> efforts : Firing her <unk> backward into the wall , firing them into this thing ’ s ... mouth ?
<unk> ?
She remembers how fast the monster is .
And how big it is .
<unk> and big .
<unk> .
<unk> might not <unk> to much , and Kai ’ Sa would <unk> die .
But at least it would be something .
She could make it hurt .
“ My true self <unk> you , ” it speaks , much too calmly .
Its voice is so loud it rattles the entire space , knocking hideous patchwork <unk> loose as thousands of Void remora <unk> from the jagged holes .
It is a voice that <unk> and contracts , whispers and screams .
The <unk> continue without end , an <unk> <unk> not by one voice , but by millions .
Kai ’ Sa ’ s eyes widen with realization .
That ’ s where all the people went .
The Void had torn through the now very former city of Belveth in under an hour .
Kai ’ Sa hadn ’ t been able to make it in time , and the <unk> <unk> was gone .
Everything .
Everyone .
What remained now resembled a giant glowing crater of shattered pieces <unk> into something <unk> alien — the structures shifting as if to recreate frozen creature shapes , frozen humanoid shapes .
Like a child setting up a toy town .
But where had the people gone ?
The vastaya ?
The animals and <unk> ?
She ’ d fought her way through the shattered city and into the <unk> at the center of the empty bay , seeing no sign of anyone — only fresh Voidborn horrors like <unk> <unk> tentacles and <unk> she ’ d been thinking of as “ <unk> of screaming <unk> . ” It didn ’ t make any sense .
The remains of a Void attack aren ’ t pretty , but usually there ’ s something left .
Now she knows why .
“ You are the city , ” Kai ’ Sa <unk> through the <unk> wall of sound .
“ Belveth ... is you . ” “ Yes , ” says Bel ’ Veth , gently undulating its — her ? — wings .
“ The raw <unk> of their lives served as the <unk> for my birth .
<unk> .
<unk> .
<unk> .
I am as much Belveth as they were , and I claim the <unk> as my own . ” Bel ’ Veth ’ s titanic body bristles .
Golden beams gently <unk> the light above her <unk> form , <unk> the Void sea ’ s false sun like the <unk> of a dying world .
New flesh <unk> as it <unk> against the <unk> of a tidal current , veins briefly illuminated before pulling themselves away from the surface of the monster ’ s skin , each somehow alive and <unk> — <unk> <unk> themselves .
<unk> of Void remora in the <unk> of thousands swim around their empress like birds circling the peak of a distant mountain .
It ’ s beautiful , in a way .
If the Void had a god , this is what it would look like .
<unk> , and monstrous , and beautiful .
Kai ’ Sa is so struck by the enormity of what she is <unk> that she doesn ’ t <unk> realize when the arms in the wall have not just let her go , but lowered her to the ground .
It ’ s hard to take in everything at once .
It chose its own name , she thinks , <unk> brushing a stray Void hand from her shoulder .
That ’ s not possible .
Void entities do not name themselves .
Most , like the <unk> ’ <unk> , are named after <unk> from Shuriman history .
<unk> by those <unk> enough — or unfortunate enough — to survive after <unk> one of the monsters out on the dunes .
They don ’ t have the presence of mind to do it , or the <unk> .
But more importantly , Voidborn do not see the value in names .
They are an invention of the living world , and they don ’ t want them .
So why does she ?
“ I ’ ll ... fight you , ” says Kai ’ Sa , defiant but unsure of what to do or where to strike .
“ I ’ ll kill you . ” “ You will not , ” reply the many voices of Bel ’ Veth .
“ You are <unk> of resistance at even its basest form .
Others have come before you , in the age before my birth .
Each <unk> hero wielding weapons they believed would <unk> the Void .
But all were <unk> consumed .
The meager fragments that remained , if they remained at all , served as salt for the Lavender Sea .
Only two still live , and of them , only you <unk> your full mind . ” “ Two ? ” “ You , and your father . ” Something sinks in the center of Kai ’ Sa ’ s chest .
Her thoughts spin wildly , <unk> on the edge of panic , but for now , she has to stay focused on this moment .
There is no <unk> whatever the empress is .
It ’ s a living abomination , the personified <unk> of <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
“ You ’ re lying , ” Kai ’ Sa <unk> .
“ That ’ s not even possible . ” “ I do not lie , Kai ’ Sa , ” the empress continues .
“ I have no need .
The Void &apos;s <unk> triumph is an <unk> absolute .
It demands no lies , <unk> , or questions .
<unk> your mind , and I will show you . ” <unk> contracts .
Bel ’ Veth ’ s gigantic body pulls and <unk> , <unk> into a smaller — and now more recognizable — shape .
She <unk> silently downward , looming over Kai ’ Sa as tendrils and <unk> <unk> to form the <unk> , segmented pretender of a human head .
Bel ’ Veth ’ s two faces <unk> her audience before the creature cloaks herself in her wings , appearing once more as a towering woman of great importance .
The <unk> is much more <unk> than the growing , Kai ’ Sa <unk> .
It <unk> the <unk> of the leviathan ’ s grand <unk> while still looking and sounding <unk> grotesque .
“ You are alive because I allow you to live , ” speaks the empress , now from her human head with its deep , perpetually disappointed voice .
“ You should have realized this by now . ” Kai ’ Sa wants to argue the point , but quickly glances at the <unk> <unk> in the ground where a single strike had sent her <unk> only moments before .
Bel ’ Veth hit so fast that Kai ’ Sa wasn ’ t even able to <unk> what had happened , and then the empress had <unk> her <unk> over two hundred times their original size in under a <unk> .
She also , <unk> , <unk> the undulating pocket of living hell — this <unk> “ Lavender Sea ” — she is surrounded by .
Not the time to <unk> a fight .
Kai ’ Sa does some quick <unk> in her head , her eyes darting around as she tries to figure out what she ’ s actually up against .
Bel ’ Veth ’ s human face <unk> with interest , <unk> its lips , then begins <unk> her .
Kai ’ Sa already knows she ’ s lost .
How fast can one person think ?
How fast can they react ?
Up against all that combined human <unk> ... all that <unk> .
In the time it takes even a skilled <unk> to <unk> a plan , hundreds of millions of <unk> run through Bel ’ Veth ’ s mind in the span of a single second as she draws from the stolen memories of everything and everyone that has ever passed through the old city — an <unk> number of lives .
Every captive opponent faced with an overwhelming enemy since the formation of Runeterra could be snapping in and out of this thing ’ s <unk> <unk> , their emotions <unk> , <unk> , endlessly <unk> over before Kai ’ Sa can even blink .
“ So what happens now ? ” Kai ’ Sa allows .
What is one answer when your opponent has a thousand ?
“ You will follow , ” says the empress , turning and floating through patches of thick , mutant coral as they bow respectfully out of her way .
Kai ’ Sa <unk> , watching her host <unk> silently through the chaotic mess of <unk> buildings , ghostly limbs , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> structures in the crude <unk> of human beings walking through a <unk> .
Great , she thinks .
Even by Void standards , this is <unk> .
“ You may ask whatever you like , ” Bel ’ Veth <unk> .
That last part gets Kai ’ Sa ’ s attention .
“ Right .
Well , first question ... What are you ? ” <unk> Kai ’ Sa , her armor now <unk> and <unk> as she follows from a safe distance .
She brushes aside a floating <unk> bear fused with a dozen flapping <unk> wings and <unk> her impulse to <unk> as the creature struggles against its own lopsided weight .
“ What is all this ?
What part of the Void do you come from ? ” “ I am the Void , ” replies Bel ’ Veth .
“ And this is what we will become . ” Kai ’ Sa <unk> .
“ But you said you were created from people .
The city .
You ’ re saying you want to become the city ? ” “ No , ” says Bel ’ Veth .
“ The Void has existed for millennia .
Before the first stars were <unk> in the emptiness beyond this world , we simply were .
Perfect , singular , and silent .
And then , there came the sound .
“ Reality was born from those whispers , and it consumed us .
We were twisted by its <unk> .
Broken .
<unk> .
We could not go back to what we were no matter how we struggled .
My <unk> — the Watchers — attempted to <unk> and destroy existence , but they were tainted by it .
<unk> to desire <unk> , to gain greater understanding ... “ And in an instant , they were betrayed .
To change so <unk> ... so completely ... only to be cast aside .
It filled them with an indescribable hatred .
They would <unk> all of reality without a second thought . ” Bel ’ Veth <unk> to a precipice overlooking a tremendous chasm .
Far above , Kai ’ Sa sees massive holes beyond the dappled <unk> sunlight .
Voidborn tunnels .
That ’ s what ’ s eating <unk> ’ s people , what destroyed Belveth , and what opened up to swallow the tent city in <unk> Shurima .
Everything the Void <unk> ends up here .
“ But , ” Bel ’ Veth continues , “ their metamorphosis was <unk> .
Only now is the true transformation beginning , ” <unk> the empress .
“ I don ’ t want to become one city .
We will become all of you . ” Kai ’ Sa reaches the <unk> of the precipice and <unk> .
She and Bel ’ Veth are gazing upon not quite a city , but Void <unk> shaped into a <unk> , seemingly endless <unk> of <unk> <unk> buildings .
Void remora <unk> among them , and dark shapes shift along winding , crooked streets .
Nothing is right .
Nothing is <unk> .
It ’ s all <unk> , like there ’ s not enough <unk> to go on .
Like all it needs is ... “ No , ” Kai ’ Sa <unk> , almost to herself .
“ The Void wants to <unk> everything .
It can ’ t exist .
To finish this , you ’ d need ... everything . ” “ Yes , ” replies Bel ’ Veth .
“ Everything .
I am the Void .
I will <unk> upon your world until there is nothing left .
And I will exist , because there is nothing you can do that will stop me . ” The empress turns to Kai ’ Sa coldly .
<unk> .
“ I offer you this , Daughter of the Void .
Your world must end for the sake of mine .
But those who came before us , the Watchers — I am an <unk> to them .
<unk> burns them , and they will destroy you , and me , and everything to stop that pain .
Should they escape their prison , there will be no breaking their tide .
Time will come to a close , and all things will end . ” Kai ’ Sa <unk> Bel ’ Veth in her false eyes , a grim defiance spreading through her .
“ You want to <unk> us out .
Why would I ever help you do that ? ” “ <unk> me in the destruction of the Watchers , and I will spare your kind ... for a moment .
A month .
A year .
More .
Perhaps , in that time , you will find a weapon that can <unk> me , or a hero who can face me .
You will not ... but you can try .
I offer one chance .
It is more than they will give you . ” Kai ’ Sa ’ s rage <unk> over as Bel ’ Veth turns away to look below , the empress watching her new world take shape .
“ What if I don ’ t want to ? ” <unk> Kai ’ Sa .
“ What if I kill you here ? ” “ You cannot , ” says Bel ’ Veth .
“ You lack the will , the knowledge , and the strength .
I am your only salvation . ” Kai ’ Sa ’ s armor <unk> violently to life , its <unk> <unk> as the suit <unk> with fear .
Kai ’ Sa tries to control it with her thoughts , but the parasite seemingly knows something she does not .
She attempts to wrestle away control , her eyes turning from Bel ’ Veth for only a moment in order to — Oh , no .
The <unk> tip of the empress ’ <unk> <unk> Kai ’ Sa in the chest , lifting her off the ground as she struggles to break free .
Kai ’ Sa fires everything she has — <unk> rain down on the empress , bolts of searing purple energy scream toward her body , and beams of light that have torn lesser Voidborn in half dance across her <unk> skin .
Nothing .
No effect .
“ Daughter of the Void .
You will find the Watchers and <unk> the truth , or your light will be <unk> out side by side with all others .
This is not a threat .
It is my promise . ” Bel ’ Veth <unk> her grip , and Kai ’ Sa <unk> into the false sky above Bel ’ Veth ’ s alien sea .
The <unk> city of <unk> <unk> below , its windows slick with <unk> and tumbling , unformed , awful things .
As Kai ’ Sa <unk> through one of the Voidborn tunnels and into the blinding light of day , the empress turns away , gazing once more over her world of want .
Kai ’ Sa bursts through the sands of southern Shurima , slamming hard against the dunes as she <unk> , her entire body pulled and tossed like a <unk> ball .
The glowing husk of the city of Belveth <unk> quietly in the distance , devoid of any recognizable life as new things <unk> through it and build the land that would spread over everything — a <unk> that would consume the world .
The entire display is <unk> awful , as if all of reality is <unk> violently in the wind .
= = = = = = THE <unk> OF <unk> = = = = = = = = <unk> HEIDE = = Cassiopeia <unk> against the <unk> rooftop , and gazed over the winding alleys and <unk> streets of <unk> .
A Noxian possession for years , the coastal city still refused to completely embrace its new <unk> — it felt ancient , and quietly <unk> to the future .
So Shuriman .
<unk> by the cool night air , Cassiopeia wore a shift of translucent silk , which revealed the <unk> at her hips where soft skin merged into sinuous , overlapping <unk> <unk> .
The scent of <unk> meat <unk> up to her hidden <unk> , but it could not mask the vile stench of thousands of people living on top of each other .
Her mouth burned as noxious venom <unk> with her saliva .
She flexed her <unk> tail , cracking the stonework and sending crumbled fragments to the streets below .
<unk> scattered from the falling stone .
<unk> street <unk> dashed around street corners as hooded figures whispered in the shadows and <unk> soldiers staggered in and out of <unk> .
All were oblivious to the predator lurking in the darkness above .
Cassiopeia brushed a taloned hand against her <unk> side , her serpentine figure concealed by the shadows .
Once , she had been a powerful figure in Noxus : <unk> killed at her slightest <unk> , soldiers spilled their darkest secrets , and <unk> willingly followed her <unk> in the hopes of <unk> .
Cassiopeia sighed .
These days , she emerged only under cover of night .
No longer was she an <unk> voice in Noxian <unk> — not since she had been reduced to this grotesque abomination in hiding .
Upon her return from the desert , Cassiopeia had hidden in the <unk> of her family ’ s <unk> , fearful of her transformation .
She remained alone in the cold , dank vault for weeks , filled with disgust for her serpentine body and mourning the loss of her <unk> life .
Eventually , a growing desire to hunt overwhelmed her , and she <unk> out to <unk> the city by night as the <unk> <unk> .
Cassiopeia put aside her <unk> as a <unk> soldier in a leather breastplate stumbled from a tavern , drink in hand .
Finally ; this was the man she ’ d been waiting for .
She trailed his movements from above , following him silently over fortress walls and <unk> , until he entered an empty courtyard .
Perfect .
Cassiopeia slithered onto an <unk> roof , eyes glinting with predatory thrill .
Her figure cast a shadow across the soldier .
He turned , drunkenly defiant .
“ I know you ’ re there !
Show yourself ! ” he said .
Cassiopeia ’ s tail twitched in anticipation .
Her <unk> tongue extended , tasting the air .
She drew the sweet scent of his blood into her lungs , then exhaled with great satisfaction .
“ <unk> me face to face ! ” he shouted .
“ I ain ’ t gonna be stalked like some animal . ” Cassiopeia let out an angry <unk> .
By the time the soldier looked up , she ’ d slid to the opposite side of the courtyard and perched directly above him , remaining out of sight in the shadows .
“ You consider yourself better than an animal , do you ? ” she said .
The man ’ s head turned abruptly , trying to <unk> the sound of her voice .
“ How ’ d you get across so fast ? ” he said , his wavering tone betraying false bravado .
“ Even beasts are nothing to your savagery , ” said Cassiopeia .
<unk> , he edged away , looking for an escape .
He hammered his fists against every door , but each was bolted shut .
Cassiopeia imagined his mind racing to solve the riddle of who was hunting him and why .
He <unk> his sword , turning on the spot , unsure where to <unk> his threat .
“ You don ’ t want to cross me .
I ’ ve <unk> worse enemies than you . ” “ Not just enemies , ” Cassiopeia replied .
“ I ’ ve seen your handiwork .
You ’ re not the only one who <unk> about in the dark . ” She spat a <unk> wad of venom as he turned toward the sound of her voice .
The man howled in pain , <unk> holes burning through his armor and into his skin .
She inhaled the satisfying <unk> of burning leather and flesh .
The man <unk> his sword .
“ Who are you ?
Why ’ re you doing this ? ” “ I ’ ve been watching you , ” replied Cassiopeia .
“ I know what you are , what you do … ” “ What I do is no business of yours . ” “ I know you ’ re <unk> children for <unk> meat .
I hear it ’ s quite <unk> . ” The man tried to <unk> open the shutters of a nearby window with the flat of his sword , but they too were bolted shut .
“ Then there ’ s the three tavern <unk> , ” said Cassiopeia .
“ <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
They were found in the river yesterday .
Their faces were hardly recognizable once you ’ d finished with them . ” She relished the thought of sinking her talons into his flesh .
The man readied his stance .
“ You can ’ t fight me from the shadows .
Show yourself ! ” “ <unk> well , ” Cassiopeia said .
She slithered down to the courtyard and rose to her full height .
The man ’ s eyes widened in horror , his hands trembling .
Cassiopeia stood head and shoulders over the man , glaring down with narrowing eyes .
“ Monster ! ” he cried .
“ Monster , ” murmured Cassiopeia .
“ Not the worst I ’ ve been called . ” She slid left and whipped her tail across his legs , effortlessly knocking him to the ground .
<unk> her tail around his chest , she squeezed his <unk> tighter and tighter , <unk> his pounding heart straining beneath her grasp .
She heard bones crack .
She resisted the urge to break him completely , and released her grip .
He crawled to his sword , grasping it in desperation .
She so enjoyed watching him tremble .
She circled him slowly .
He met her gaze and stared in slow recognition .
“ I know your face .
The Lady Cassiopeia ! ” he said .
“ Look at you ! ” Point to the ground , he pushed himself onto his feet with his sword .
“ You chase <unk> like me through the filthy <unk> of this city now , is that it ? ” The man spat a wad of blood .
“ From such great heights we fall , <unk> ? ” She hissed , exposing dripping yellow fangs .
Cassiopeia ’ s gaze bored into the man ’ s eyes , locking them in a <unk> bond .
She screamed , pouring all her rage into the cry ; fury at the <unk> of her current state , anger at the loss of her <unk> life , resentment for her failed ambitions .
She channeled it all into the screeching , <unk> wail .
As she screamed , her fury was replaced with joy .
It felt like she was floating , her potential for <unk> infinite .
Every fiber of her being sang with ancient power .
Searing emerald light blazed from Cassiopeia ’ s eyes .
The man ’ s final panic was <unk> in silhouette as he <unk> from the inside out .
His stare hardened , greyed , and stiffened , his last cry of terror <unk> as her curse transformed his flesh to stone .
Cassiopeia slithered up to the statue and softly caressed its hard cheek .
What was once skin fractured into a <unk> pattern <unk> a dried <unk> .
“ Once , I had to manipulate , <unk> , or otherwise … <unk> people to <unk> my <unk> , ” she said .
“ But now … Now I simply take what I want . ” She whipped her tail forward , smashing the statue to the ground .
She smiled , eyes glinting , as it shattered into a thousand pieces of rubble and dust .
Cassiopeia <unk> with pride as she considered her handiwork .
Her life as a noble was over , yes , but never had she felt such boundless power coursing through her veins .
She slithered back onto the rooftops , her mind awhirl with <unk> .
Her next victim would offer her a far greater challenge .
= = = = = = <unk> WORK = = = = = = = = UNKNOWN = = Night had always been Diana ’ s favorite time , even as a child .
It had been that way since she was old enough to <unk> over the walls of the Solari temple and watch the moon <unk> the vault of stars .
She looked up through the dense forest canopy , her violet eyes scanning for the silver moon , but seeing only its <unk> glow through the thick clouds and dark branches .
The trees were pressing in , black and <unk> , their branches like crooked limbs reaching for the sky .
She could no longer see the path , her route forward obscured by rank <unk> and grasping <unk> .
<unk> thorns scraped the curved plates of her armor , and Diana closed her eyes as she felt a memory stir within her .
A memory , yes , but not her own .
This was something else , something drawn from the fractured <unk> of the celestial essence that shared her flesh .
When she opened her eyes , a shimmering image of a forest <unk> the <unk> trees before her .
She saw the same trees , but from a different time , from when they were young and <unk> and the path between them was dappled with light and edged in <unk> .
<unk> in the harsh <unk> of Mount Targon , Diana had never seen a forest like this .
She knew what she was seeing was an echo of the past , but the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> were as real as anything she had <unk> .
“ Thank you , ” she whispered , following the spectral outline of the ancient path .
It led Diana through <unk> and withered trees that ought to have been long dead .
It climbed the slopes of rocky <unk> , and passed through stands of twisted pine and wild <unk> .
It crossed tumbling mountain <unk> and wound its way around sheer slopes before bringing her to a rocky plateau overlooking a vast lake of cold , dark water .
At the center of the plateau was a circle of towering stones , each carved with looping spirals and <unk> sigils .
On every stone Diana saw the same <unk> that shimmered upon her forehead and knew she had reached her destination .
Her skin <unk> with a sense of <unk> anticipation , a sensation she had come to associate with wild and dangerous magic .
<unk> now , she approached the circle , eyes scanning for threats .
Diana saw nothing , but she knew something was here , something utterly hostile and yet somehow familiar .
Diana moved to the center of the circle and drew her sword .
Its crescent blade glittered like diamond in the <unk> moonlight <unk> the clouds .
She knelt with her head bowed , the blade ’ s tip resting on the ground , its quillons at her cheeks .
She felt them before she saw them .
A sudden drop in pressure .
A raw charge to the air .
Diana surged to her feet as the <unk> between the stones split apart .
The air buckled and a trio of screeching beasts charged her with ferocious speed ; ivory flesh , bone-white <unk> of segmented armor and steel talons .
<unk> .
Diana dived beneath a snapping jaw filled with teeth like <unk> <unk> , slashing her sword in an overhead arc that clove the first monster ’ s skull to its heavy shoulders .
The creature fell , its flesh instantly <unk> .
She rolled to her feet as the others circled like pack hunters , now wary of her gleaming blade .
The creature she had killed now resembled a pool of <unk> <unk> .
They came at her again , one from each side .
Their flesh was already darkening to a bruised purple , hissing in this world ’ s hostile atmosphere .
Diana leapt over the <unk> beast and swung her sword in a crescent arc towards its neck plates .
She yelled one of the Lunari ’ s holy words and <unk> light blazed from the blade .
The beast blew apart from the inside , gobbets of <unk> flesh disintegrating before the moonblade ’ s power .
She landed and swayed aside from the last beast ’ s attack .
Not fast enough .
<unk> talons punched through the steel of her <unk> and dragged her around .
The beast ’ s chest split apart , revealing a <unk> mass of sense organs and hooked teeth .
It bit into the meat of her shoulder and Diana screamed as numbing cold spread from the wound .
She spun her sword , holding the grip like a dagger and rammed it into the beast ’ s body .
It screeched , <unk> its hold .
<unk> black ichor poured from its ruptured body .
Diana spun away , biting down on the pain racing around her body .
She held her moonblade out to the side as the clouds began to thin .
The beast had tasted her blood and hissed with predatory hunger .
Its armored form was now entirely <unk> black and <unk> purple .
Bladed arms unfolded and remade themselves in a <unk> of hooks and talons .
<unk> flesh flowed like <unk> to seal the awful wound her blade had ripped .
The essence within Diana surged .
It filled her thoughts with undying hatred from a distant <unk> .
She glimpsed ancient battles so terrible that entire <unk> had been lost in the fires of their <unk> ; a war that had almost unmade this very world and still might .
The creature charged Diana , its body rippling with the raw power of another realm of existence .
<unk> parted and a brilliant <unk> of silver speared downwards .
Diana ’ s sword drank in the radiance of distant moons and light burned along its edge .
She brought it down in an <unk> ’ s arc , cleaving plated bone and woven flesh with the power of the night ’ s <unk> .
The beast came apart in an explosive <unk> of light , its body utterly unmade by her blow .
Its flesh melted into the night , leaving Diana alone on the plateau , her chest heaving with <unk> as the power she had joined with on the mountain withdrew to the far reaches of her flesh .
She blinked away <unk> of a city that echoed with emptiness where once it had pulsed with life .
<unk> filled her , though she had never known this place , but even as she mourned it , the memory faded and she was Diana again .
The creatures were gone and the stones of the circle gleamed with threads of silver radiance .
<unk> from the touch of the hateful place on the other side of the veil , their healing power seeped into the earth .
Diana felt it spreading into the landscape , carried through rock and root to the very bones of the world .
“ This night ’ s work is done , ” she said .
“ The way is sealed . ” She turned to where the moon ’ s reflection shimmered in the waters of the lake .
It beckoned to her , its irresistible pull <unk> deep in her soul as it drew her ever onwards .
“ But there is always another night ’ s work , ” said Diana .
= = = = = = A GOOD <unk> = = = = = = = = MATT DUNN = = Magga was about to die for the <unk> time .
She had <unk> into a rotten <unk> – yet again .
Its putrid flesh had , as always , infected her with <unk> .
The actress went through the <unk> of <unk> to her death while shouting her final words for all to hear .
“ Oh , but how <unk> a dream is life ?
Only now — too late ! — do I wake to see its myriad of <unk> , ” she <unk> .
With a <unk> of smoke and glittering powder , Kindred made a grand entrance upon the stage .
As <unk> <unk> , they were played by one actor , his head covered by two <unk> masks .
He approached Magga , the white mask of the Lamb facing her .
“ <unk> !
Do I hear a plea for my keenest arrow ?
Come , child , let the warmth of your heart fade into the cold embrace of oblivion . ” Magga refused , as she had thirteen times before .
Any <unk> in her performance was buried beneath the <unk> <unk> of her scream .
On <unk> , Lamb spun around , revealing the second mask – that of the Wolf .
“ There is naught ye can do to <unk> off thine end , ” growled Wolf .
“ I am but a poor young maiden !
Please , let my piteous cry fall on all four of thine ears . ” The audience seemed <unk> by the <unk> dramatics of the Orphellum Mechanicals .
With the twin threats of plague and war on the tongues of those in neighboring <unk> , death <unk> were all the rage .
Denji , the actor <unk> both Lamb and Wolf , descended upon the young actress , awkwardly baring wooden fangs .
Magga offered her neck .
At the threat of Wolf ’ s bite , she <unk> the <unk> sewn into her <unk> ’ s collar .
<unk> of red fabric <unk> to the <unk> <unk> and <unk> of the audience .
They ’ d gotten what they <unk> for .
By the time the Mechanicals had staggered back to their wagon and set off in the direction of Needlebrook , there were no stars to be seen .
Instead , a veil of clouds stretched across the night sky .
Needlebrook always <unk> a good audience , Illusian , the company ’ s <unk> and sole <unk> , explained once more .
He staggered around , drunk on his own <unk> — as well as the wine Parr had <unk> from the locals .
The night wore on , and the troupe had descended into <unk> .
Tria and Denji <unk> their playwright over the quality of his plots , which fell into a <unk> structure : tragedy strikes maiden , death <unk> maiden , death takes maiden .
Illusian argued that <unk> plots <unk> from a good death scene .
Magga , the <unk> of the <unk> , agreed with Tria and Denji ’ s <unk> , but kept her mouth shut .
Had she not stowed away in the wandering troupe ’ s wagon , she would <unk> be somewhere far more miserable .
<unk> for her , the Mechanicals had recently lost several actors due to Illusian ’ s <unk> on complete <unk> control .
Because of his <unk> — and obvious <unk> — they were facing a <unk> of fresh faces .
And so , the Orphellum Mechanicals agreed to <unk> Magga to die in all their dramatics for the <unk> future .
For which she had been <unk> .
Illusian was still <unk> from Denji and Tria ’ s words when he <unk> to Parr , their <unk> , to stop and make camp .
The inebriated <unk> set out his bedroll in pride of place next to the wagon .
He then threw the rest of the bedding into the long grass nearby .
“ <unk> players can sleep in the wilds , ” Illusian spat , “ where they shall <unk> find their manners . ” The rest of the troupe built a fire and swapped stories .
Denji and Tria had fallen asleep in each other ’ s arms while whispering potential names for their <unk> child into each other ’ s ears .
They had <unk> on about the day the traveling company would stop in <unk> , a town so perfect and peaceful they would set aside their <unk> ways to raise their child .
Magga moved closer to the crackling fire so its <unk> and <unk> would drown out the <unk> <unk> of her traveling <unk> .
But sleep never came .
Instead , Magga tossed and turned , thinking about the looks on the audience ’ s faces as the coiled <unk> of blood unfurled from her <unk> .
A pretty maiden struck dead by her own <unk> was all the <unk> pomp Illusian could muster , but the crowd <unk> after the gruesome façade .
Eventually , she left her bedroll and set out into the woods to <unk> her <unk> mind .
In the dead of night , Magga came upon a low <unk> <unk> with slabs of standing stone at its base .
<unk> she could not read the inscriptions , her fingers traced the familiar <unk> of Kindred ’ s twin masks .
This was a place of the dead , a <unk> <unk> built long ago .
She felt a chill on the back of her neck that compelled her to look up .
She was not alone .
Magga immediately understood what she saw , for she ’ d encountered a crude <unk> of them night after night .
But poor Denji couldn ’ t begin to <unk> the dread washing over Magga .
Before her , perched on a weathered <unk> , was Lamb herself , flanked by her <unk> <unk> , Wolf .
“ I hear a beating heart ! ” said Wolf , his black eyes twinkling with delight .
“ May I have it ? ” “ Perhaps , ” replied Lamb .
“ I sense she is afraid .
Speak , beautiful one .
Tell us your name . ” “ I-I would have yours first , ” stammered Magga , stepping backward .
Her slow escape was <unk> by the speedy Wolf , who materialized <unk> close behind her .
He spoke directly in her ear .
“ We have many names . ” “ In the <unk> , I am <unk> to his <unk> , ” said Lamb .
“ In the <unk> , <unk> to his <unk> .
But we are Kindred everywhere .
I am always Lamb to Wolf , and he is always Wolf to Lamb . ” Wolf reared up and <unk> at the air .
“ She is playing a boring game , ” said Wolf .
“ Let us play a new game , one of chasing and running and biting . ” “ She is not playing , dear Wolf , ” said the Lamb .
“ She is frightened and has lost her own name .
It hides behind her lips , afraid to come out .
<unk> not , dear child , I have found your name .
We know it as you know us , Magga . ” “ <unk> , ” Magga stammered .
